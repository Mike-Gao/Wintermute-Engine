<h3>File extension</h3>
<p>Specifies the file extension to be used for saved game files of your game. If 
you are going to integrate the game with Game Explorer in Windows Vista, you 
should specify a unique file extension (for example based on the name of your 
game, such as <em>DeadCitySav</em>), because this extension will allow the 
players to load the game directly from Windows Explorer.</p>
