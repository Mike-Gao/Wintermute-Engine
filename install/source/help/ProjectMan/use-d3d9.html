<h3>Use Direct3D 9</h3>
<p>If enabled, the game will take advantage of Direct3D 9 (as compared to 
Direct3D 8 when this option is disabled). Currently the only advantage is better 
performance for 3D characters when using hardware T&amp;L.</p>
<p>Note that WME requires at least the June 2007 release of Direct3D 9. You may 
need to refresh your DirectX installation using the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=2DA43D38-DB71-4C1B-BC6A-9B6652CD92A3">
DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer</a>.</p>
<p>If you are distributing your game on CD, include the latest DirectX Runtime 
installer. If you are distributing your game online, direct the players to the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=2DA43D38-DB71-4C1B-BC6A-9B6652CD92A3">
DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer</a>.</p>
<p>If the game displays a &quot;missing library D3DX9_34.DLL&quot; at startup, it means 
you need to refresh your DirectX installation.</p>
<p><strong>New in WME 1.8.6:</strong> The &quot;Project settings&quot; window now contains 
a check-box titled &quot;<em>Include D3DX library (for games using Direct3D 9)</em>&quot;. 
When enabled, ProjectMan will copy the Direct3D extension library (D3DX) to the 
output folder while compiling the game. That way the end users will not need to 
install the latest Direct3D 9 redistributable package (which turned out to be a 
major support issue). However, technically speaking, distributing this file with 
your game violates the DirectX EULA. Please choose whichever option you consider 
the lesser evil. </p>
