<h3>Rich saved games</h3>
<p>Enable this option if you are going to integrate your game with Game Explorer 
in Windows Vista. If enabled, the saved games will be augmented with some extra 
data, which will allow Windows Vista to display the name and thumbnail of the 
saved games, and to include the saved game description in file indexing.</p>
