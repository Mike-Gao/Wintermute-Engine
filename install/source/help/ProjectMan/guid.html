<h3>GUID</h3>
<p>&quot;GUID&quot; stands for globally unique identifier. It is a large random number 
which uniquely identifies your game in the whole world. Once assigned, you 
shouldn&#39;t change this number, especially if your game has already been released 
to public.</p>
<p>This GUID is used for integrating the game with Game Explorer in Windows 
Vista.</p>
