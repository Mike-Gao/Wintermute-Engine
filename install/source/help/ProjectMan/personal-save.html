<h3>Personal saved games</h3>
<p>If disabled, the saved games are stored directly in the game directory. If 
enabled, the saved games are stored in the &quot;Documents and Settings&quot; directory in 
Windows XP and earlier, or in the global &quot;Saved games&quot; directory in Windows 
Vista.</p>
<p>This option is only present for legacy reasons and <strong>should be always set to 
Yes</strong>, or your game might not be able to save games when run in Windows Vista!</p>
