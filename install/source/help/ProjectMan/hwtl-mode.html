<h3>Hardware T&amp;L</h3>
<p>Specifies the usage of hardware transform and lighting. This option is only 
useful for games using 3D characters, there&#39;s no point in enabling it for fully 
2D games. Hardware T&amp;L moves some 3D calculations from CPU to video card, which 
can significantly improve performance when using Direct3D 9.</p>
<p>But this feature comes with a price. If enabled, the maximum number of active 
lights in one scene will be limited by the capabilities of a video card. This 
limit is usually 8 active lights. Therefore you should only enable this option 
if your scenes are designed with limited number of lights in mind.</p>
<p>There are three available modes:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>don&#39;t use</em> - Hardware T&amp;L is disabled.</li>
	<li><em>use when available</em> - Hardware T&amp;L will be used if the video 
	card supports it (most video cards do).</li>
	<li><em>ask user</em> - The settings dialog will contain a check box, 
	allowing the player to choose whether to use HW T&amp;L or not.</li>
</ul>
