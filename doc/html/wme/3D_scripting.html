<h1>Scripting support</h1>

<p>The 3D characters support brings several new scripting methods and 
attributes. You will find a complete listing in the <a href="scripting_ref.html">
scripting reference</a> section of this manual, but let's take a quick look into 
some of the most commonly used methods.</p>

<h2>Creation and basics</h2>

<p>To load a 3D actor use either
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_game.html#LoadActor3D">Game.LoadActor3D()</a> 
method or <a href="generated/scripting_ref_scene.html#LoadActor3D">
Scene.LoadActor3D()</a> methods. They work exactly the same as their original 
counterparts (LoadActor()). These methods create a new 3D actor object, which 
provides a set of methods and attributes fairly similar to those provided by 2D 
actors. Besides the original
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#TurnTo">TurnTo()</a> method which 
turns the actor into one of eight directions, 3D actors also provide a
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#TurnToAngle">TurnToAngle()</a> 
method, which can be used to turn the character to any angle.</p>

<h2>Animations</h2>

<p>Animations work very differently than in case of 2D actors. Instead of lots 
of separate files, all the animations are part of the model files and they are 
then listed in the actor definition file. The
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#PlayAnim">PlayAnim()</a> method 
only accepts the name of the animation to be played. In addition, you can play 
several animations at one time. Each animation can affect only some of the 
bones, therefore you can combine several animations into one; for example the 
actor can walk while making some gesture with their arm (the arm animation only 
modifies arm bones thus partially overrides the walking animation). Use the
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#PlayAnimChannel">PlayAnimChannel()</a> 
method to achieve this. There are 10 independent animation channels available, 
numbered from 0 to 9. The 0 channel is used internally by the engine for 
standard animations, such as walking, talking and standing.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, the engine recognizes these standard animation by their 
name, which means your actor definition file should contain animations named 
&quot;walk&quot;, &quot;idle&quot; and &quot;talk&quot;. You can override those names using the <b>
WalkAnimName</b>, <b>IdleAnimName</b> and <b>TalkAnimName</b> attributes. What 
is this good for? Well, for example if you want to temporarily change walking to 
running, set the WalkAnimName to &quot;run&quot; and the actor will use the &quot;run&quot; 
animation for walking (providing animation with this name exists).</p>

<p>It is possible to load new actor animations at runtime. The 3D actor provides 
a <a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#MergeAnims">MergeAnims()</a> 
method, which will load animations from an external X model file. If you need to 
specify additional animations options (looping animation or animation events), 
you will need to create a definition file pairing the X model. For example, 
let's say you want to load an animation called &quot;throw&quot;, which is stored in file 
&quot;trinity_throw.x&quot;. To specify animation options, create a new file called &quot;trinity_throw.anim&quot; 
in the same directory where the X file is located. This definition file will 
contain one or more ANIMATION sections, using exactly the same syntax as the
<a href="3D_actors_x.html#animations">actor definition file</a>. WME will 
automatically use the trinity_throw.anim file when loading trinity_throw.x 
model.</p>

<p>To release animation which is no longer needed from memory, use the
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#UnloadAnim">UnloadAnim()</a> 
method.</p>

<h2>Attachments</h2>

<p>WME allows you to attach 3D models to 3D actors. This can be used for various 
purposes, such as the actor holding an item in their hand, a hat on their heads 
etc. The attachment can be created using the
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#AddAttachment">AddAttachment()</a> 
method, and removed using the
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#RemoveAttachment">
RemoveAttachment()</a> method. To query an existing attachment, use the
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#GetAttachment">GetAttachment()</a> 
method. It returns an attachment object, which provides its own set of scripting 
methods and properties.</p>

<h2>Direct control</h2>

<p>Among the primary point'n'click interface, WME also provides a set of methods 
for direct keyboard control for 3D characters. These include
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#DirectWalk">DirectWalk()</a>,
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#DirectWalkBack">DirectWalkBack()</a>,
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#DirectWalkStop">DirectWalkStop()</a>,
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#DirectTurnLeft">DirectTurnLeft()</a>,
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#DirectTurnRight">DirectTurnRight()</a> 
and <a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#DirectTurnStop">
DirectTurnStop()</a>. The WME 3D characters demo already contains a script which 
demonstrates the use of those methods (scripts\direct_control.script).</p>

<p><br>
There are more methods available, see the <a href="scripting_ref.html">scripting 
reference</a> for details.</p>

<h2>Textures</h2>

<p>You can change model textures at runtime using the
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#SetTexture">SetTexture()</a> 
method. Since your model can be using several textures you have to specify which 
one you're changing by specifying material name. Material name defaults to the 
name of the original texture assigned to your model, without extension. For 
example, if you assigned texture called &quot;path\some_texture.png&quot; in the 3D 
modeling software, you reference the material by name &quot;some_texture&quot;.</p>

<p>The new texture can be either a static image or WME sprite, which means you 
can have animated textures. But note that only the images and frame delays are 
imported from the sprite, all the additional sprite properties used for 2D 
graphics are ignored when using a sprite as an animated texture for 3D models.</p>
<h2>Video textures</h2>
<p>You can even use Theora videos as 3D model textures using the
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#SetTheoraTexture">SetTheoraTexture()</a> 
method. The use is exactly the same as the <strong>SetTexture()</strong> method 
(see above). Keep in mind the video dimensions must be powers of two (2, 4, 8, 
16, 32, 64, 128...). Keep the video textures as small as possible not to degrade 
game performance needlessly.</p>

<hr>

<h2><span class="style1">Meshes - MS3D format only (deprecated)</h2>

<p>You can also modify the appearance of the actors. There is set of methods 
working with &quot;meshes&quot;. A mesh is part of the model; usually the model is 
separated into multiple meshes based on different materials. You can hide or 
show individual parts of the model using the
</span>
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#HideMesh" class="style1">HideMesh()</a><span class="style1"> and
</span>
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#ShowMesh" class="style1">ShowMesh()</a><span class="style1"> methods.</p>

<p>You can also load a new mesh from a separate file. This is useful if you want 
- for example - make the actors hold an item in their hands. A new mesh can be 
loaded using the </span> 
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#AddMesh" class="style1">
AddMesh()</a><span class="style1"> method. This method accepts filename of another MS3D file, the 
name of the mesh and the name of the bone you want this new mesh attach to. This 
way you can for example attach a hat model to character's head, or insert some 
object into his hand. The new mesh is &quot;glued&quot; to the given bone and inherits all 
its movements and rotations.</p>

<p>Last of the methods dealing with individual meshes is
</span>
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#RemoveMesh" class="style1">RemoveMesh()</a><span class="style1">. It 
permanently removes one mesh from the model.</span></p>
