<h2>Music support in WME</h2>
<p>The Wintermute Engine provides various music related functions. All of them 
are exposed as methods of the Game object. See the <a href="scripting_ref.html">
Script language reference</a> for a detailed description of each method.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#standard">Standard music playback</a></li>
  <li><a href="#multi">Multi-channel music and cross-fading</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="standard"></a>Standard music playback</h3>
<p>The most important is probably the <b>Game.PlayMusic()</b> method. You pass 
it a sound file (Wav or Ogg), and specify if the music should loop or not.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber3">
  <tr>
    <td class="code">
<pre>Game.PlayMusic(&quot;music\MyMusic.ogg&quot;, true);
</pre>    
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The above line tells WME to play the MyMusic.ogg file and that it should 
start over once the music finishes.</p>
<p>But since it's not always easy for the musician to achieve a seamless 
transition when the music starts over, the <b>PlayMusic()</b> has a third 
optional parameter, which specifies the point from which the music should start 
when looping. This point is specified in milliseconds:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber4">
  <tr>
    <td class="code">
<pre>Game.PlayMusic(&quot;music\MyMusic.ogg&quot;, true, 6890);
</pre>    
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>This command will play the MyMusic.ogg file, but once the playback reaches 
the end of the file, it skips to 6890 milliseconds from the beginning.</p>
<p>There are many other music functions but their names are usually 
self-describing like <b>Game.StopMusic()</b>, <b>Game.GetMusicPosition()</b> 
etc. See the <a href="generated/scripting_ref_game.html"><b>Game</b> object 
scripting reference</a> for a complete list with a detailed description.</p>
<p>You will usually put the <b>Game.PlayMusic</b> call to the scene_init.script 
of the scene where your music should start to play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="multi"></a>Multi-channel music and cross-fading</h3>
<p>While the standard set of functions described in the previous article is able 
to work with a single music channel, WME provides a second set of functions, 
allowing you to work with multiple music channels. WME supports up to 5 music 
channels numbered 0 - 4. </p>
<p>The multi-channel music methods have similar names as their single-channel 
counterparts, but the word &quot;Music&quot; is replaced by the word MusicChannel. For 
example there are two methods for playing the music:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Game.PlayMusic(Filename, Looping, LoopStart)</li>
  <li>Game.PlayMusicChannel (Channel, Filename, Looping, LoopStart)</li>
</ul>
<p>All the multi-channel music functions take a channel number as the first 
parameter. The channel number can be a number in range from 0 to 4. On the other 
hand, the single-channel methods operate always on channel 0.</p>
<p>Again, see the <a href="generated/scripting_ref_game.html"><b>Game</b> object 
scripting reference</a> for a detailed description of both single-channel and 
multi-channel music methods.</p>
<p>The multi-channel music support comes with the ability to cross-fade two 
music channels. WME has a <b>Game.MusicCrossfade()</b> for this purpose. You 
need to tell this method what two channels you want to cross-fade, and how long 
should the cross-fade take. You can also specify, if the two channels should be 
swapped after the cross-fading is over. This is useful to always hold the main 
melody in the same channel.</p>
<p>This is the typical scenario of using the music cross-fading. You'll start 
the first channel playback somewhere, usually at the scene entry, i.e. in the 
scene_init.script:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber5">
  <tr>
    <td class="code">
<pre>Game.PlayMusicChannel(0, &quot;music\FirstChannel.ogg&quot;, true);
</pre>    
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The music is now playing at channel 0. Now, once some event happens, we want 
the music to seamlessly cross-fade to other tune. What we need to do is to start 
playback in other channel and call the <b>MusicCrossfade</b> method:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber6">
  <tr>
    <td class="code">
<pre>Game.PlayMusicChannel(1, &quot;music\SecondChannel.ogg&quot;);
Game.MusicCrossfade(0, 1, 3000);
</pre>    
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Those two lines will start the playback in the channel 1 and will initiate 
the cross-fade. The cross-fading will take three seconds and once it's over, the 
channels will be swapped, i.e. you still have the main music playing in channel 
0, only the music file is now different.</p>
<p>Sometimes you may want to start the second channel not from the beginning, 
but from a certain point. In that case you'd call the <b>
Game.SetMusicChannelPosition</b> method first:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber7">
  <tr>
    <td class="code">
<pre>Game.SetMusicChannelPosition(1, 10000);
Game.PlayMusicChannel(1, &quot;music\SecondChannel.ogg&quot;);
Game.MusicCrossfade(0, 1, 3000);
</pre>    
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
