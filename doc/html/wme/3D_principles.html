<h1>Principles and requirements</h1>
<p>You are probably already familiar with the scene creation process in WME. If 
not, go and read the <a href="inside_scenes.html">Scene creation tutorial</a>. 3D characters support builds on 
the same principles but adds several new steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The characters</h2>
<p><br>
Unlike the 2D characters, the actors are not composed by a bunch of sprites. The 
3D actor is represented by a 3D model. WME supports the Microsoft X format for 
storing models. There are X exporters for most major 3D modeling packages. See
<a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.dead-code.org/wakka.php?wakka=Xfiles">this 
WME Wiki page</a> for up-to-date information on X file creation in various 3D 
programs. </p>
<p>WME uses so-called skeletal animations to animate the 3D models. You define a 
set of bones (the skeleton) and then attach parts of your model (the skin) onto 
various bones. Rotating and moving the bones will then make the skin bend 
appropriately. If this approach is new to you, see the  documentation 
and tutorials for programs like
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.fragmosoft.com/">fragMOTION</a> or
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.swissquake.ch/chumbalum-soft/">Milkshape 3D</a> for more details on how to create skeletal animated characters.</p>
<p><br>
Among the 3D model itself, you will need to create an actor definition file, 
describing various properties of the 3D actor to WME. The structure of this file 
is described in <a href="3D_actors_x.html">another chapter of this documentation</a>.</p>
<p><br>
Once you have both the 3D model in X format (.x) and the actor 
definition file (.act3d), WME is ready to use your character in a game. To load 
the character from a script, you will call the
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_game.html#LoadActor3D">Game.LoadActor3D()</a> 
or <a href="generated\scripting_ref_scene.html#LoadActor3D">
Scene.LoadActor3D()</a> methods. The usage is exactly the same as for the old <b>
LoadActor</b> method used for 2D characters.</p>
<p><br>
A word of warning: Keep the <b>polygon count</b> of your character models <b>as low as 
possible</b> (generally a few thousands of triangles). It requires a lot of skill to 
create a good looking low-poly character, but it's necessary for real-time 
rendering. In other words, forget about Poser models and such, because they are 
far too detailed to be used in real-time 3D environment.</p>
<p>Also make sure the dimensions of the <b>textures</b> you use are <b>powers of 
two</b> (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024...). This is a limitation of 
current 3D accelerators. Normally when using 2D graphics WME overcomes this 
limitation by resizing the images automatically but in case of real-time 3D 
models you will have to deal with it yourself.</p>
<p>Using textures larger than 1024 pixels is not recommended, because some older 
video cards cannot handle them correctly. On the other hand, you will probably 
rarely need larger textures for 3D characters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The scenes</h2>
<p>Unlike the ordinary 2D scenes, you will need to add an extra layer to your 
scenes to support hosting 3D characters in them. This layer is called the 
&quot;hidden scene geometry&quot;. Basically it's a simple 3D model which defines the 3D 
layout of your scene. It defines the walk-planes and blocked objects. Although 
this 3D model is never actually visible to the player, the 3D characters are 
using it to navigate the scene. They are walking on invisible 3D planes and they 
avoid hidden blocked objects.</p>
<p>Once again, this hidden geometry has to be created in some 3D modeling 
software and then saved in the <b>3DS format</b>. 3DS is the only format WME 
accepts as scene geometry. This format is very popular and you should be able to 
export is from most 3D packages.</p>
<p><br>
The hidden geometry file contains the following components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Walk-planes</li>
  <li>Blocked objects</li>
  <li>Waypoints</li>
  <li>Lights</li>
  <li>Cameras</li>
  <li>Other objects for shadow casting purposes</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
As you can see, the geometry already contains the information used for 
navigating actors within the scene. Therefore you don't have to use the blocked 
regions, normal waypoints and scale levels as described in step 4 and step 5 of 
the <a href="inside_scenes.html">Scene creation tutorial</a>, these are 
superseded by scene geometry. Other than that the scene designing process is 
exactly same as described in the tutorial.</p>
<p>Now, how to create the hidden geometry? The idea is that most people will use 
3D pre-rendered backgrounds together with real-time 3D characters. Hardly anyone 
would want to combine them with hand-drawn locations. It means you already have 
a detailed 3D model of the scene, including camera and lights setting. All you 
need to do now is to add the walk-planes and blocked objects to the scene. They 
will not be used for the actual scene rendering, but they will be exported to 
WME.</p>
<p>For WME to recognize the right objects in the exported file, they need to be 
named in a certain way. Walk-plane names have to start with <b>&quot;walk_&quot;</b>, for 
example &quot;walk_floor&quot;, blocked object names start with <b>&quot;blk_&quot;</b>, for example 
&quot;blk_desk&quot; and waypoint names start with <b>&quot;wpt_&quot;</b>, for example &quot;wpt_01&quot;.<br>
All lights and cameras are recognized automatically.</p>
<p>To define the hidden geometry, create planes where characters can walk, then 
create objects bounding inaccessible areas. Typically these blocked objects will 
be simple cubes surrounding some scene objects and areas that cannot be entered 
by actors. For example see the scenes in WME 3D demo. Both the warehouse and the 
crates in foreground are surrounded by cubes, making those areas inaccessible 
for the characters.</p>
<p>Waypoints are typically created as small cubes. WME only uses one point from 
the cube as the actual waypoint and it also drops the waypoints to the floor. 
The rules for correct waypoint placement are basically the same as for normal 
waypoints, as described in step 5 of <a href="inside_scenes.html">scene tutorial</a>. 
You place the waypoint at the edges of your blocked objects and there must be a 
direct unblocked path between two waypoints for the character to be able to use 
this path.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Starting with WME 1.6 you can use the old good &quot;2D way&quot; of scene 
navigation even for 3D actors, to simplify scene design. See the
<a href="3D_additional.html">additional 3D options</a> chapter for more details.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><img border="0" src="../img/new.png" width="28" height="11">New in WME 
1.7:</b> Since the introduction of stencil shadows the hidden geometry needed a 
bit more flexibility. Therefore it's now possible to couple the 3DS file with a 
second definition file, which describes additional options. The definition file 
is stored in the same directory as the 3DS file, uses the same filename, but with 
.geometry extension (for example, if your geometry file is called 
&quot;some_scene.3ds&quot;, the geometry definition file would be called &quot;some_scene.geometry&quot;).</p>
<p>This definition file can contain one or more sections, describing groups of 
meshes contained in the 3DS file. Each group is defined by a name pattern and 
additional properties. The name pattern can use wildcards (* for any group of 
characters, ? for any single character) which allows you to address several 
meshes at once. Then, for each group of meshes you can specify: 1) whether they 
are walkplanes 2) whether they are blocked objects 3) whether they are waypoints 
4) whether they receive shadows. For example, to match the naming conventions 
described above, your geometry definition file would look like this:</p>
<pre><font color="#800000">GEOMETRY
{
  NODE
  {
    NAME = "walk_*"
    WALKPLANE = TRUE
    RECEIVE_SHADOWS = TRUE
  }

  NODE
  {
    NAME = "blk_*"
    BLOCKED = TRUE
  }

  NODE
  {
    NAME = "wpt_*"
    WAYPOINT = TRUE
  }
}</font>
</pre>
<p>Notice the RECEIVE_SHADOWS line. It means the walkplanes will receive stencil 
shadows. You could, for example, add additional meshes to your 3DS file, to use 
for shadow receiving (typically you'll need more detailed scene model for 
shadows than you need for pathfinding). Let's assume you named these meshes with 
names starting with &quot;SHADOW_&quot;. To say you want all meshes starting with SHADOW_ 
to receive shadows, you'd add the following section to the definition file:</p>
<pre><font color="#800000">  NODE
  {
    NAME = "shadow_*"
    RECEIVE_SHADOWS = TRUE
  }</font></pre></p>
<p>Since this node doesn't contain neither of the WALKPLANE/BLOCKED/WAYPOINT 
options, these meshes will only be used for shadow casting. WME Demo 3D is using 
this definition.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>You don't need to specify the standard mesh groups (walk_, blk_, 
wpt_), they are recognized automatically.</p>
<hr>
<p>If this sounds too confusing at first, just take a look at the 3DS file in 
WME 3D demo, it will give you the idea of how the scene geometry should look. If 
you have access to 3D Studio Max, you can also open the original .MAX file (in 
the &quot;original files&quot; folder). It contains the detailed scene model together with 
scene geometry. Scene geometry objects are marked as invisible so that they are 
not rendered. Also all the scene geometry objects are stored as a named 
selection, to make it easy to select them all and export them into the 3DS file 
(using the File-&gt;Export selected command).</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../img/3dsmax.png" width="398" height="280"></p>
<p>Keep the scene geometry objects simple (cubes, planes etc.). The simpler the 
objects are the faster is loading in WME and the faster can WME find paths for 
characters. Only export this simplified scene model, not the original detailed 
one, it's of no use to WME.</p>
<p>Cameras and lights can be exported directly as they are. You will typically 
use the same camera for both rendering the scene in the 3D program and for 
displaying 3D characters in WME. This way the 2D and 3D parts are perfectly 
overlaid.</p>
<p>Once you have exported the scene geometry into a 3DS file, all you need to do 
is to assign it to a WME scene. To do so, open the scene in SceneEdit, select 
the &quot;3D&quot; tab and select the 3DS file. If the file contains multiple cameras, you 
can select the right one. Also, you will have to fill-in the resolution your 
game will use. The resolution setting is used only by SceneEdit to display the 
scene geometry correctly.</p>
<p>In most cases you'll only need to set the camera and game resolution here, 
but there are some additional options available, described in
<a href="3D_additional.html">another chapter</a>.</p>
