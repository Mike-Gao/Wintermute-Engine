<h1>System requirements</h1>
<p>Wintermute Engine runtime and the tools 
require DirectX 8.0 or later to run.</p>
<p>The tools require Internet Explorer 4.0 
or later to be installed (it doesn’t have to be set as a default browser).</p>
<p>Supported operating systems are:</p>
<ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
  <li>Microsoft Windows 98/98SE/Me</li>
  <li>Microsoft Windows 2000/XP or later</li>
</ul>
<p>Older Windows versions (Win95, WinNT 4.0 
etc.) are unsupported because Microsoft doesn’t provide DirectX 8 for them.</p>
<p>Hardware requirements depend on the 
complexity of your game, but a 3D accelerated video card is highly recommended. 
WME takes advantage of hardware acceleration to speed up the drawing operations 
and to provide advanced graphic effects such as alpha blending and antialiasing. 
If the hardware acceleration isn’t available on end-user’s computer, WME runs in 
so called “compatibility mode”. The compatibility mode is slower and the 
advanced graphics effects are disabled.</p>

    You can setup your game to require 
    the 3D hardware acceleration. If you do so, the user won't be able to run the 
    game unless a 3D accelerated video card is available on his system.
