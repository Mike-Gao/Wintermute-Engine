<h2>String Table Manager</h2>

<p><b>WME String Table Manager</b> is a simple tool for extracting all in-game 
texts from your WME project and export them to a string table for localization 
purposes. It also modifies the game files and scripts and replaces the original 
string occurences with their &quot;localizable&quot; form.</p>

<p>For example this line in the script:</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
  <pre><font color="#800000">this.Talk(&quot;Hello, miss.&quot;);</font></pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>will become:</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
  <pre><font color="#800000">this.Talk(&quot;/str0003/Hello, miss.&quot;);</font></pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>And the generated string table will contain the extracted string:</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
  <pre><font color="#800000">str0003 Hello, miss.</font></pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>For more information on localization support in WME please see the
<a href="inside_localization.html">Localization</a> chapter.</p>

<h3>Quick user's guide</h3>

<p>Start the program and fill in the two text boxes. Choose a path to your WME 
project file (.wpr) and a path to a string table. You can either select an 
existing string table file, or a non-existing. In the latter case the file will 
be created.</p>

<p>Additionally you can check or uncheck the &quot;Backup old files&quot; option. 
It is recommended to leave this option enabled. (Note: If you have the project 
file open in WME Project Manager, please close it, otherwise String Table 
Manager won't be able to save the localized name of the game to the 'default.game' 
file.)</p>

<p>Once the paths are set, click the &quot;Scan project&quot; button. String Table Manager 
will extract all strings from the project and load the contents of the original 
string table (if any). It will then try to automatically remove all strings 
which are not supposed to be translated (e.g. event names, item names, file 
names, scene node names etc.).</p>

<p>After the project is scanned, click the &quot;Manage strings&quot; button. It will open 
a new window which contains all the localizable strings on the left and all the 
ignored string on the right. Now please carefuly examine the lists. If there are 
still some strings left which shouldn't be localized, you can move them to the 
right list. Right-click the item and choose either &quot;Ignore item&quot; or &quot;Always 
ignore item&quot; from the context menu. The &quot;Always ignore&quot; command will add the 
string to the global ignore list, therefore next time you scan the project, this 
string will be automatically ignored.<br>
Similarly, you can return any ignored string back to the left list by 
right-clicking it and choosing the &quot;Unignore item&quot; command from the context 
menu.</p>

<p>The left list allows you to choose several items at once by checking the 
check-boxes on the left. To select a block of items, select the first one, then 
hold the Shift key and click the last item. Similarly, to deselect a block of 
items, select the first one, then hold Ctrl+Shift keys and click the last item.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can use the &quot;Selection&quot; submenu in the context menu 
to select all/none, invert selection, or only select items with no string ID 
assigned.</p>

<p><br>
<img border="0" src="../img/stm2.png" width="660" height="561"></p>

<p>Make sure the left list only contains strings which are supposed to be 
translated. Now you can assign the unique string ID to each of the string. You 
will probably want to choose multiple items before assigning the IDs.<br>
Choose one or more items, right-click and select the &quot;Assign string ID...&quot; 
command from the context menu. Now you need to choose the string ID itself. You 
can choose any word/code you want, for example &quot;str&quot;. You can either assign the 
same code to all the strings in the game, or you can use different code 
depending on the string context (for example, you might use different codes 
depending on which character uses the line).</p>

<p>Fill in the code and click OK (the window offers you all the codes previously 
used in your project). String Table Manager will now assign the chosen code to 
all the selected items, and it adds a number to make the string IDs unique.<br>
<br>
After all strings were assigned a string ID, click the &quot;Close&quot; button and return 
back to the main window. Here you can save the changes back to your project 
files by clicking the &quot;Save changes&quot; button. This command will add the new 
strings to the end of the string table, and it will replace the original strings 
in your game files/scripts with their localizable form (see above).<br>
<br>
<br>
You can go through this entire process multiple times, as you add new game 
content. String Table Manager will extract all the newly added strings and 
you'll be able to assign a string ID to them.</p>
