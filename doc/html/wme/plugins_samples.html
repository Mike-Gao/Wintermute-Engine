<h2>Samples</h2>
<p>Since this documentation barely scratches the surface, and since the best way 
of learning is by studying examples :) there are three sample plugins prepared for 
you. You can use them to learn more about the structure of the plugins and about 
the techniques used. You can also use them as a starting point for your own plugins.</p>
<p>You can find the plugin sources in the &quot;Plugin&quot; subdirectory of the WME 
installation directory. The sample plugins are:</p>
<p><b>wme_sample</b> - A very simple plugin providing two classes (&quot;Sample&quot; and 
&quot;AnotherSample&quot;). The &quot;Sample&quot; class simply maintains one member variable, 
allows setting/getting it and modifying it using a script method. The member 
variable is serialized. The &quot;AnotherSample&quot; class is more interesting. It 
subscribes the update and scene-init events. The plugin uses the update event to 
display current time every 10 seconds. The scene-init event is used to display a 
welcome message whenever the player enters a new scene.</p>
<p><b>wme_snow</b> - This is a more advanced plugin. It's basically a recreation 
of Jerrot's
<a target="_blank" href="http://forum.dead-code.org/index.php?topic=368.0">
WeatherGod</a> snow-generating script. This plugin dynamically generates a bunch 
of WME entities to represent the snowflakes and animates them on the update 
event. It provides a couple of scripting methods and properties, it can 
serialize its state. Also notice that the plugin contains the default flake 
image in resources.</p>

<p><b>wme_sample_pixel</b> - This plugin demonstrates pixel operations on WME 
sprite subframes. It handles the update event and on each update it updates all 
the pixels of a subframe.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>WME directory also contains one WME project called &quot;wme_plugins_demo&quot;. This 
simple project demonstrates the usage of snow and pixel plugins.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Helper functions library</h2>

<p>The &quot;Plugin&quot; directory also contains a library of several convenience helper 
functions. They can be found in the &quot;src&quot; subfolder and they are contained as 
static methods of CWmeUtils class. Currently there are functions for returning a 
random number, for working with RGBA color values and for serializing string 
variables. This library might be farther expanded in the future.</p>
