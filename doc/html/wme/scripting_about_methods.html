<h3>Custom methods and objects</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Custom methods</h4>
<p>You already know the engine provides predefined objects (such as actors, 
entities, scenes etc.) and those objects offer you methods you can call from 
your scripts. But WME also allows you to define your own methods for these 
objects. Defining a 
method is very similar to defining a <a href="scripting_about_functions.html">
function</a>, but instead of the <b>function</b> keyword you have to use <b>
method</b> keyword. Such a function is then visible from the &quot;outside&quot;, i.e. you 
can call it exactly the same way as the hard-coded engine methods.</p>
<p>All you need to do is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>create a script file</li>
  <li>define one or more methods in the script</li>
  <li>attach the script to an object (e.g. to an actor)</li>
</ol>

<p>Example:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber1">
  <tr>
    <td class="code"><pre>method MyTestMethod(parameter)
{
  Game.Msg("This is my test method. The parameter was " + parameter);
}
</pre></td>
  </tr>
</table>
&nbsp;<p>Once you attach the above script to some object (either in the object 
definition, or using a GUI tool such as SceneEdit, or using the <b>AttachScript</b> 
method), you can call the method from another script:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber2">
  <tr>
    <td class="code"><pre>SomeObject.MyTestMethod(&quot;some parameter&quot;);
</pre></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>If you need to reference the object owning the method, use the <b>this</b> 
keyword. This pseudo-variable holds a reference to the object the current script 
is attached to.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the scripting in WME, the engine is unable to detect 
misspelled method names at compile time; those will be detected at runtime and 
will cause a runtime error. This is the only drawback of the methods compared to 
ordinary functions.</p>
<p>You can also override the engine built-in methods, such as Talk or GoTo by simply defining a 
method with the same name. But it's strongly recommended to call the original 
method from within your custom implementation. The following example overrides 
the built-in GoTo method. It writes the requested destination to screen and then 
calls the original GoTo method to perform the actual walking.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber2">
  <tr>
    <td class="code"><pre>method GoTo(X, Y)
{
  Game.Msg("The actor is about to walk to " + X + ", " + Y);
  this.GoTo(X, Y);
}
</pre></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</pre></td>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Custom objects</h4>
<p>The previous chapter mentions you can use custom methods to enhance existing 
engine-defined objects. But WME also allows you to create new object from 
scratch. First you need to create a script file, containing all the methods your 
new object should provide. When you want to instantiate the object, use the 
following syntax:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber2">
  <tr>
    <td class="code"><pre>// create a new object&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var MyObject = new Object(&quot;script_filename&quot;);

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // now we can call its methods&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MyObject.MyMethod();</pre></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>From now on you can call MyObject's methods as they are defined in the script 
file, referenced by &quot;script_filename&quot;.</p>

<p>You can use this approach for variety of tasks. For example you can create 
&quot;code libraries&quot;, i.e. objects providing various shared utility functions. This 
is the (only) way how WME supports global functions shared between multiple 
scripts.</p>
