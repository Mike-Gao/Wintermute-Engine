<h3>Version 1.8 (September 23, 2007)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>WME is now available in two versions, Direct3D 8 and Direct3D 9. You can 
	select which version of the runtime should be used in project settings in ProjectMan.</li>
	<li>New option &quot;Hardware T&amp;L&quot; in ProjectMan to enable hardware accelerated 
	transform and lighting for 3D models.</li>
	<li>New <strong>WindowEdit tool</strong> for editing windows, inventory boxes and response 
	boxes.</li>
	<li><strong>Windows Vista integration support</strong>. WME games can now be 
	integrated in Vista's Game Explorer. The changes are too numerous to be 
	listed here. Please see the &quot;Windows Vista support&quot; chapter in the 
	documentation for a detailed description.</li>
	<li>Changes to animation handling for 3D characters:<ul>
		<li>The StopAnim() method now accepts an optional transition time.</li>
		<li>There is a new <strong>actor3D.AnimStopTransitionTime</strong> 
		property for specifying the time it takes to transition back to default 
		pose once animation ends.</li>
		<li>Non-looping animations played using the PlayAnimChannel() method no 
		longer get stuck at final frame.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>New <strong>WME crash reporting library</strong> which can upload crash details to a 
	database or send it by email. Please upload crash reports so that common 
	crash causes can be analyzed and fixed.</li>
	<li>Optimized rendering speed of tiled images, bitmap fonts and particles.</li>
	<li>New format for 2D actors definition file. It allows you to define any 
	number of named animation sets. The animation sets can be then switched at 
	runtime using the new <strong>actor.IdleAnimName</strong>, <strong>actor.WalkAnimName</strong>, 
	<strong>actor.TalkAnimName</strong>, <strong>actor.TurnLeftAnimName</strong> and 
	<strong>actor.TurnRightAnimName</strong> 
	properties. Additionally you can load new animation sets at runtime using 
	the <strong>actor.MergeAnims()</strong> method and unload them using the
	<strong>actor.UnloadAnim()</strong> method. The actor.PlayAnim() method now 
	accepts either a script filename or an animation set name. Basically all 
	this is an effort to make 2D actors handling more flexible and more similar 
	to the 3D actors model.</li>
	<li>Direct keyboard movement for 3D characters now also works for scenes 
	with 2D blocked regions.</li>
	<li>New &quot;Require sound&quot; option in ProjectMan. If enabled the game will not 
	run without a sound card (can be used for games which heavily rely on sound 
	design).</li>
	<li>String tables now accept space as a separator, not only tabs.</li>
	<li>WME Integrator now also supports UEStudio.</li>
	<li>The numpad + and - keys in SceneEdit now also work for adding waypoints, 
	not only region vertices.</li>
	<li>Changed the way method calls are terminated (see
	<a target="_blank" href="http://forum.dead-code.org/index.php?topic=2287.0">this forum thread</a> for a detailed description). Since this is a 
	potentially breaking change, it's possible to restore the previous behavior 
	using the &quot;Compatibility&quot; property in ProjectMan.</li>
	<li>New debugging options in ProjectMan. You can now specify&nbsp; that you 
	want to include the crash reporting library with the compiled games and that 
	you want the FPS display / debug mode to be enabled for the compiled games. 
	It's useful for building alpha/beta versions of the game. </li>
	<li>New &quot;copy as is&quot; file filter in ProjectMan, which specifies that certain 
	file types aren't included in game packages, but rather copied to the output 
	directory. Useful for TrueType fonts and AVI videos.</li>
	<li>ProjectMan now displays short help for all the project options.</li>
	<li>New property <strong>Game.MaxActiveLights</strong> which returns the 
	maximum number of lights supported by video card.</li>
	<li>New property <strong>Game.HardwareTL</strong> to check whether the game 
	is using hardware transform and lighting.</li>
	<li>New property <strong>Game.StartupScene</strong> and a corresponding 
	setting in ProjectMan. The standard template now takes advantage of this 
	property instead of hardcoding the filename of the scene.</li>
	<li>New Scene event <strong>SceneShutdown</strong> which is triggered just 
	before the scene is about to be changed.</li>
	<li>New method <strong>Scene.GetLightColor()</strong> for querying the color 
	of a 3D light.</li>
	<li>New <strong>Game.GetFileChecksum()</strong> method for calculating a 
	checksum (CRC32) of a specified file (useful for copy protection schemes).</li>
	<li>New scene methods and properties for querying lights and 3D nodes:
	<strong>Scene.NumLights</strong>, <strong>Scene.GetLightName()</strong>,
	<strong>Scene.IsLightEnabled()</strong>, <strong>Scene.IsNode3DEnabled()</strong>.</li>
	<li>New method for storing the saved game thumbnail (i.e. you can now 
	specify the exact moment when to take the screenshot if you need to, instead 
	of letting the engine do it automatically) - <strong>Game.StoreSaveThumbnail()</strong>. 
	Similarly, the <strong>Game.DeleteSaveThumbnail()</strong> can be used to 
	release the stored thumbnail.</li>
	<li>New 3D actor methods for checking if an animation is playing: <strong>actor3D.IsAnimPlaying()</strong>, 
	<strong>actor3D.IsAnimChannelPlaying()</strong>.</li>
	<li>New 3D actor methods for specifying animation transition time for 
	various animation pairs: <strong>actor3D.SetAnimTransitionTime()</strong>,
	<strong>actor3D.GetAnimTransitionTime()</strong>.</li>
	<li>New 3D actor property for specifying which channel to use for talking 
	animations: <strong>actor3D.TalkAnimChannel</strong>.</li>
	<li>New global functions for working with the HSL color model (Hue, 
	Saturation, Luminance): <strong>MakeHSL()</strong>, <strong>GetHValue()</strong>,
	<strong>GetSValue()</strong>, <strong>GetLValue()</strong> (requested for 
	easier changing of light intensity).</li>
	<li>The video subtitle files (.sub) can now use the &quot;localizable&quot; form of 
	text (&quot;/string_id/actual text&quot;) which means you can localize video subtitles 
	using the string table, just like any other in-game text.</li>
	<li>The Game.PlayVideo() and Game.PlayTheora() methods now allow you to 
	explicitly specify a video subtitles file.</li>
	<li>ProjectMan now provides two actions for files: Open and Edit. 
	Double-click defaults to &quot;Open&quot;. These actions use the Windows Explorer file 
	associations.</li>
	<li>ProjectMan now allows you to compile a single package, so that you don't 
	need to recompile the entire project after making minor changes. Right-click 
	a package in ProjectMan and choose the &quot;Compile this package&quot; command.</li>
	<li>FIX: Custom scene properties were not reset on scene transitions.</li>
	<li>FIX: Compiled game packages were sometimes referencing more files than 
	how many they actually contained.</li>
	<li>FIX: The check-boxes in the settings dialog no longer disappear when 
	pressing the Alt key in XP/Vista.</li>
	<li>FIX: When using multiple particle sprites the particle emitter was 
	always choosing only one of them.</li>
	<li>FIX: The engine no longer issues absolute path warnings when working 
	with personal saved games stored in &quot;Documents and and Settings&quot; folder.</li>
	<li>FIX: TrueType fonts are now only registered for WME, not for all 
	applications (Win2000/XP/Vista).</li>
	<li>FIX: Fixed many hard-to-replicate crash bugs reported by users using the 
	new crash reporting feature. Keep the reports coming!</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

	uses global SFX volume, Entity.PlayTheora() inherits volume of its parent 
	entity.</li>
	<li>FIX: Memory leak in String.Split().</li>
	<li>FIX: Changing script order in ProjectMan didn't work 
	correctly.</li>

<ul>
  <li><b>Stencil shadow support for 3D characters.</b>
  <ul><li>Stencil shadows are projected onto hidden scene geometry. For that 
	reason, more detailed geometry is necessary. It is now possible to include 
	meshes only for the shadow casting purposes in the geometry 3DS file. See 
	the &quot;3D Characters -&gt; Principles and requirements&quot; chapter in the docs for 
	updated hidden geometry discussion.</li>
  <li>3D actors can now reference a separate low-poly model for stencil shadow 
	generation purposes (see the &quot;3D actor definition file&quot; in the docs).</li>
  <li>It's possible to set shadow detail level on scene-per-scene base directly 
	in SceneEdit (you can only enable stencil shadows in some scenes if you need 
	to).</li>
  <li>New attributes and methods: <b>Game.MaxShadowType</b>, <b>
  Game.IsShadowTypeSupported()</b>, <b>Scene.MaxShadowType</b>, <b>
  Actor3D.ShadowType</b>.</li>
  <li>There is a new chapter called &quot;Shadows&quot; in the docs which describes all 
	the supported shadow types, and their pros and cons.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>

<b>Debugging console</b>. The console allows the developer to inspect running 
scripts and the values of script variables at runtime. It also allows setting 
breakpoints to pause game flow at specified script lines. See the &quot;Debugging 
console&quot; chapter in the documentation for more details.</li>
<li>

<b>String Table Manager</b>. A new tool for extracting game texts and 
managing the string table for localization purposes. See the &quot;String Table 
Manager&quot; chapter in the documentation for more details.</li>
<li>

here</a>.</li>
<li>Changed the behavior of scene scrolling for 2.5D scenes. WME now assumes the 
camera overviews the entire scene (previous versions assumed camera only 
overviewed the top-left part of the scene). The original behavior can be 
restored by checking the &quot;Scene scrolling pre-1.7&quot; checkbox in SceneEdit.</li>
  <li>X models now support the &quot;AnimTicksPerSecond&quot; attribute exported by some 
	3D packages.</li>
  <li>Added right-to-left reading order support for the game settings dialog 
	(see the &quot;Localization support&quot; chapter in the docs).</li>
  <li>Upgraded to the latest version of Theora decoder, which now uses MMX 
	instructions to improve performance.</li>
  <li>New scripting methods and attributes:<ul><li><b>Game.TalkSkipButton</b> - 
	specifies which mouse button can be used to skip talk lines (left, right, 
	both, none).</li><li><b>Game.ClearResponses()</b> - clears any responses previously added by 
Game.AddResponse().</li><li><b>Game.ChangingScene</b>

</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Version 1.6 (May 13, 2006)</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>3D actors are now using the Microsoft X model format.</b> The 3D actor 
	definition files have changed, so did the scripting support. The old format 
	is still supported for backward compatibility, but it's now deprecated. See 
	the &quot;3D characters support&quot; chapter in the documentation for more details 
	and for migration hints. Some of the notable improvements to the new 3D 
	character format:<ul><li>Smooth transitions between animations.</li><li>The 
	ability to change actor's texture at runtime, you can also use WME animated 
	sprites for textures.</li><li>The attachments are now independent scriptable 
	objects.</li><li>
    New standard animations, <b>TurnLeft</b> and <b>TurnRight</b>.</li><li>3D 
	scenes can now be setup to use <b>2D-based pathfinding</b>, i.e. you can use 
	the same way of designing blocked areas and waypoints as you would use for 
	2D actors; see the &quot;Additional 3D options&quot; chapter in the documentation for 
	details.</li><li>New <b>DrawBackfaces</b> attribute for 3D actors which 
	specifies whether the 3D model should display polygons facing away from the 
	camera.</li></ul></li>
  <li><b>New particle generator system</b>. See the &quot;Particle effects&quot; chapter 
	in the documentation for more details. There is a new &quot;wme_particles&quot; demo 
	project with several predefined particle effects available.</li>
  <li><b>Accessibility support.</b> WME now provides options for improving 
	accessibility for visually-impaired players. These include sending written 
	text to text-to-speech synthesizer, manually highlighting active areas on 
	screen using keyboard shortcuts and pausing the game at any time. There are 
	also some new scripting methods and attributes to support accessibility. See 
	the <b>Accessibility</b> chapter in the documentation for a detailed 
	discussion.</li>
  <li><b>Multi-monitor support improvements.</b> WME window now opens on the 
	correct monitor in both windowed and full-screen mode. The mouse pointer is 
	locked on the correct monitor in full-screen mode. WME tools now use the 
	right video device depending on which monitor they are displayed.</li>
  <li><b>WME is now more bullet-proof to common developer mistakes.</b> Some of 
	the engine/tools crashes caused by developer mistakes have been handled 
	(syntax errors in definition files etc.). Missing images and sprites are now 
	replaced by a generic &quot;invalid image&quot; picture making them immediately 
	obvious to the developer. WME now issues a log-file warning if the game 
	references some file using an absolute path, which will cause problems after 
	compiling the game and running it on a different computer.</li>
  <li>The startup settings window has been redesigned to accommodate new 
	options. <b>Note:</b> The standard string table now contains new localizable 
	strings. Please update the string table of your game.</li>
  <li>New <b>BlendMode</b> attribute for actors, entities and particle emitters, 
	which allows you to set the drawing mode (normal, additive blending, 
	subtractive blending).</li>
  <li>New <b>Game.LastResponseOrig</b> attribute, which returns the last 
	selected dialogue response in it's original form, i.e. before it got 
	localized (useful for games with automatic voice-overs).</li>
  <li>New <b>RightDoubleClick</b> event.</li>
  <li>If you are using multiple inventories, each inventory remembers its scroll 
	offset, so when switching from one inventory to another the original scroll 
	offset is restored.</li>
  <li>New <b>Game.InventoryScrollOffset</b> attribute for setting and querying 
	current scroll offset of the inventory box.</li>
  <li>All inventory items are now accessible using the new <b>Game.TotalNumItems</b> 
  attribute and <b>Game.QueryItem()</b> method.</li>
  <li>New <b>Game.SmartItemCursor</b> property to only highlight the mouse 
	pointer with selected item if the object can handle the item.</li>
  <li>New <b>Game.SetSceneViewport()</b> and <b>Scene.SetViewport()</b> methods 
	for changing the scene viewport at runtime.</li>
  <li>New <b>Game.SoundBufferSize</b> attribute for setting the size of sound 
	buffer used for streamed sounds/music.</li>
  <li>New <b>Game.SuspendedRendering</b> attribute to temporarily disable screen 
	refreshes. Useful when you need to run multiple script updates in one frame.</li>
  <li><b>Entity.PlayTheora()</b> method for entities now takes Entity.Scale into 
	account, video is scaled accordingly.</li>
  <li>ProjectMan no longer tries to check for WME updates if there's no active 
	internet connection.</li>
  <li>The debugging settings file formerly named dcgf.ini has been renamed to 
	wme.ini.</li>
  <li>WME installation folder now contains the script language reference in XML 
	format. Useful for third-party tools.</li>
  <li>BUGFIX: Custom camera FOV is correctly restored when loading a saved game.</li>
  <li>BUGFIX: Changes to save/load to prevent memory leak causing long save/load 
	times under certain conditions.</li>
  <li>BUGFIX: The GUI buttons no longer display mouse-hover effects when game 
	isn't in interactive state.</li>
  <li>BUGFIX: Inventory items animations didn't work correctly after saving game 
	and loading it after restarting Windows.</li>
  <li>BUGFIX: 3D actors' direction/angle became broken after using the keyboard 
	rotation.</li>
  <li>BUGFIX: Item.GetHoverSprite() and Item.GetSprite() methods were broken.</li>
  <li>BUGFIX: Division by decimal numbers lesser than 1.0 no longer causes 
	&quot;Division by zero&quot; error.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Version 1.5.2 (October 9, 2005)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The <b>Game.AddResponse*()</b> methods now accept an optional font 
	filename to be used for a given response.</li>
  <li>WME now automatically uses speech sounds if their filename matches the 
	string table ID of a given speech line, no need to explicitly reference 
	speech files in scripts. New <b>Game.AddSpeechDir()</b> and <b>
	Game.RemoveSpeechDir()</b> 
  for setting directories to look for speech files in.</li>
  <li><b>Improvements to the plugins API</b>; New IWmeSubFrame class which 
	allows plugins to modify sprites on pixel level. New methods for creating 
	scripting objects from within plugins and for easier setting value 
	properties.</li>
  <li>BUGFIX: Crash on exit when using custom TTF fonts.</li>
  <li>Many, many mistakes in the documentation have been fixed (thanks to odnorf).</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Version 1.5 (July 23, 2005)</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Support for Theora video.</b> WME can now play videos in
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theora.org/">Ogg Theora</a> format which 
	brings many advantages over the AVI video playback. There is a new <b>
  Game.PlayTheora()</b> method, and additionally the scene entities are also 
	able to play Theora videos, which means you can easily incorporate streaming 
	video elements directly into game scenes. Please see the &quot;Using Theora&quot; 
	chapter in the documentation for more details. Special thanks to #wme 
	channel regulars for their help with Theora testing and encoding.</li>
  <li><b>Support for advanced plugins.</b> In addition to simple DLL library 
	calls from scripts WME now provides a standardized programming interface for 
	plugin development. This allows experienced programmers to develop extension 
	modules for the engine. Please see the &quot;Plugin development&quot; section in the 
	documentation for more details.</li>
  <li><b>Additional options for 3D scenes.</b> SceneEdit now offers several 
	additional options when designing scenes with hidden 3D geometry. Developers 
	are now able to set clipping planes and waypoints placement, which should 
	help to troubleshoot common problems with 3D characters.</li>
  <li>The <b>Game.PlayVideo()</b> and <b>Game.PlayTheora()</b> methods now offer 
	an optional parameter specifying whether the background music should be 
	muted while the video is playing.</li>
  <li>New <b>Game.Frozen</b> attribute for checking current game state.</li>
  <li>New <b>Game.TextRTL</b> attribute which should allow displaying 
	bi-directional text (Hebrew and Arabic) while using TrueType fonts.</li>
  <li>New <b>Game.Direct3DDevice</b> and <b>Game.DirectDrawInterface</b> 
  attributes to allow plugins accessing directly the underlying DirectX 
	interfaces used by WME.</li>
  <li>The project settings in ProjectMan now include the ability to set which 
	plugins should be distributed with the game.</li>
  <li>BUGFIX: Occasional crashes when using TrueType fonts.</li>
  <li>BUGFIX: Incorrect text wrapping and alpha color when using TrueType fonts.</li>
  <li>BUGFIX: The &quot;ActorLeave&quot; events were sometimes incorrectly triggered when 
	entering a new scene.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Version 1.4.1 (May 23, 2005) - hotfix</h3>

<ul>
  <li>New <b>LoadSound()</b> method which allows to pre-cache a sound file so 
	that any subsequent PlaySound calls don't slow the game down (useful for 
	frequent playing of the same sound).</li>
  <li>FIX: The engine didn't play short sounds (bug introduced in version 1.4).</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Version 1.4 (May 17, 2005)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Support for advanced sound effects (echo and reverb). All the game objects 
	now provide three methods, <b>SoundFXNone()</b>, <b>SoundFXEcho()</b> and <b>
  SoundFXReverb()</b>. These methods affect any sounds played by the object.</li>
  <li>Support for TrueType fonts. WME can now render any in-game texts using 
	TrueType fonts. See the &quot;Fonts&quot; chapter in the documentation for a detailed 
	description of this functionality.</li>
  <li>Support for Unicode string tables. WME can now read string tables with 
	Unicode characters (encoded in UTF8 format). This allows games to be 
	translated to a wide variety of languages, including Asian languages. Note 
	that you have to use TrueType fonts to display texts in these languages. See 
	the &quot;Localization&quot; chapter in the documentation for further details.</li>
  <li>New <b>Actor.SetSprite()</b> method which allows you to temporarily change 
	actor's appearance.</li>
  <li>The <b>PlaySound()</b> method now accepts an optional parameter specifying 
	a loop-start point for looping sounds (similarly to loop-start for music).</li>
  <li>The <b>Game.Reset()</b> method now reloads inventory items definitions, 
	which means even deleted items get restored after resetting the game. There 
	is also a new <b>Game.LoadItems()</b> method for loading/merging a new item 
	set.</li>
  <li>Entity container controls now provide a <b>Freezable</b> attribute which 
	specifies if the contained entity is frozen when game enters a frozen state.</li>
  <li>The <b>Game.DisplayLoadingIcon()</b> now provides an optional parameter 
	which specifies if the loading icon should stay on screen until <b>
  Game.HideLoadingIcon()</b> is called. This allows you to display a loading 
	icon even on scene transitions.</li>
  <li>New diagnostic method <b>Game.DumpTextureStats()</b> which writes texture 
	memory usage status to a text file.</li>
  <li>Wme.exe now exports two external functions to allow StarForce copy 
	protection to be attached (experimental).</li>
  <li>FIX: Several mistakes and broken links in documentation were removed.</li>
  <li>FIX: Some MS3D animations weren't properly animated.</li>
  <li>FIX: The tools crashed on startup if DirectX 8.0 or later wasn't installed 
	(they still crash but now they display an error message before)</li>
  <li>FIX: The Game.MusicCrossfade() method uses the current music volume as its 
	target volume, not 100%.</li>
  <li>FIX: Reloading actor from file didn't invalidate the Game.MainObject 
	attribute which caused crashes on Win9x systems.</li>
  <li>FIX: Actor.RemoveMesh() no longer crashes the engine.</li>
  <li>FIX: The engine occasionally crashed after loading a saved game if save 
	thumbnails were enabled.</li>
  <li>FIX: Streaming animations didn't work correctly with JPG images.</li>

<h3>Version 1.0, build 031 (July 10, 2003)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>fixed several bugs introduced in build 030 ;-)</li>
</ul>



<h3>Version 1.0, build 030 (July 06, 2003)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>bugfix: window.GoSystemExclusive() has been incorrectly freezing window's 
	own controls</li>
  <li>bugfix: nested <b>switch</b> commands were resulting in an infinite loop 
	(thus hanging the engine)</li>
  <li>bugfix: Scene.SkipTo(actor) method has been setting the vertical scene 
	scrolling position incorrectly when called from a scene init script</li>
  <li>new <b>Game.GetSoundLength(SoundFilename)</b> method which returns a 
	length of a given sound in milliseconds</li>
  <li>new <b>Game.FPS</b> attribute (read-only) which returns the current 
	framerate (in frames per second)</li>
</ul>



<h3>Version 1.0, build 028 (June 08, 2003)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>support for PNG graphics format</li>
  <li>new <b>PlaySoundEvent(SoundFilename, EventName)</b> method which triggers 
	an event after the sound finishes</li>
  <li>new <b>Game.GetNumResponses()</b> which queries the number of responses 
	left in the response box</li>
  <li>new <b>Game.GetCurrentDlgBranch()</b> which returns the name of the 
	dialogue branch currently executing (or null)</li>
  <li>new <b>AlphaColor</b> attribute for actors and entities which overrides 
	the scene shading color</li>
  <li>new <b>CloseUp</b> attribute for scene layers; close-up layers make all 
	underlying scene layers non-interactive</li>
  <li>the engine displays names of the current and previous scene when running 
	in debug mode</li>
  <li>the help file can be called directly from the tools</li>
  <li>SpriteEdit: now it's possible to copy alpha color and transparent color to 
	all frames</li>
  <li>some of the ProjectMan dialog windows were redesigned to allow for an 
	easier localization</li>
  <li>bugfix: SpriteEdit offers a correct folder when adding new frames</li>
  <li>bugfix: some template files were referencing wrong fonts</li>
  <li>bugfix: it wasn't possible to delete currently playing sound files in 
	ProjectMan</li>
  <li>bugfix: automatic sound panning wasn't working for the &quot;sound-only&quot; 
	entities</li>
  <li>bugfix: speech subtitles were misplaced in case of a very long string 
	table ID</li>
</ul>


<h3>Version 1.0, build 025 (April 21, 2003)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>(experimental) localization support for ProjectMan and the engine runtime</li>
  <li>bugfix: the initial settings window was always displayed</li>
  <li>bugfix: Game.PrevScene now returns an empty string if it's a first scene</li>
  <li>bugfix: corrected the alphabet misspellings in ProjectMan :-)</li>
  <li>bugfix: Scene:GetRegionAt now searches the regions from top to bottom</li>
  <li>bugfix: SceneEdit now preserves the scene viewport correctly</li>
</ul>


<h3>Version 1.0, build 024 (April 11, 2003) - bugfix release</h3>
<ul>
  <li>fixed bug in the script compiler; if there were nested loops, the <b>break</b> 
	command was sometimes exiting a wrong loop</li>
  <li>added the ability to set subtitles speed (either in ProjectMan or in 
	script using the <b>Game.SubtitlesSpeed</b> attribute</li>
  <li>(experimental support for sprite rotation)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.0, build 022 (April 05, 2003)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>dialogue system enhancements</li>
  <li>simple DLL library interface for scripts</li>
  <li>scripting language enhancements (<b>switch</b> statement and <b>Array</b> 
	class, both similar to JavaScript)</li>
  <li>several buxfixes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0, build 020 (March 22, 2003)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>you can define a rectangular area on screen where the scene will be 
	displayed - the scene viewport (i.e. scenes no longer need to cover the 
	whole screen); it's useful for fixed interface elements</li>
  <li>the engine is now able to remember which scene nodes were active/inactive 
	when the player leaves the scene and this state will be restored 
	automatically after revisiting the scene (i.e. you no longer need to script 
	this behavior manually); just check the &quot;Remember nodes state&quot; check-box in 
	SceneEdit</li>
  <li>scene entities have a new &quot;Ignore items&quot; property (in SceneEdit); if you 
	set this property, the entities will act as non-interactive when the player 
	attemts to use an inventory item on them - it's useful for example for the 
	scene exits</li>
  <li>the GUI windows now can contain entites; this makes the whole GUI 
	subsystem much more flexible; it allows you to create &quot;intelligent&quot; windows, 
	such as items close-ups or a Runaway style inventory</li>
</ul>
