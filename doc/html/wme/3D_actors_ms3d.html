<h1>Actor definition file, MS3D format (deprecated)</h1>

<p><b><font color="#FF0000">NOTE: 3D actors in MS3D format are now deprecated 
and provided for backward compatibility only.</font></b></p>

<p>Similarly to the ordinary actors, you define 3D actors by creating a simple 
definition files. These files use the .act3d extension and use the same syntax 
as other WME files. This is an example of a 3D actor definition file:</p>

<p>
<pre><font color="#800000">ACTOR3D
{
  NAME = "trinity"
  CAPTION = "Trinity"
  INTERACTIVE = TRUE
  SCRIPT = "actors\trinity\trinity.script"

  SCALE = 180

  ;--- velocities
  VELOCITY = 70.0
  ANGULAR_VELOCITY = 400.0

  ;--- external data
  MODEL = "actors\trinity\trinity.ms3d"
  FONT = "fonts\outline_red.font"  
  CURSOR = "sprites\arrow.sprite"

  SHADOW = TRUE
  SIMPLE_SHADOW = TRUE

  ; real-time shadow settings
  LIGHT_POSITION { -40, 200, -40 }
  SHADOW_COLOR { 0, 0, 0, 128 }

  ; simple shadow settings
  SHADOW_SIZE = 12.0
  SHADOW_IMAGE = "actors\trinity\shadow.png"
  



  ANIMATION
  {
    NAME="walk"
    LOOPING=TRUE
    START_FRAME=1
    END_FRAME=25

    EVENT
    {
      FRAME = 4
      NAME = "footstep"
    }

    EVENT
    {
      FRAME = 16
      NAME = "footstep"
    }
  }


  ANIMATION
  {
    MODEL = "actors\trinity\trinity2.ms3d"
    NAME="idle"
    LOOPING=TRUE
    START_FRAME=26
    END_FRAME=65
  }
}</font>

</pre>
Most of these properties are optional. WME tries to use reasonable default 
values for them.</p>

<p>The first block defines the usual properties, name, caption, interactivity 
and script assignment. You should already know these. If not, take a look at the
<a href="inside_actors.html">Actors chapter</a>.</p>
<p>The <font color="#800000">SCALE</font> property affects the overall scale of 
the character. You will typically use this property if your character model uses 
different scale than your scene models, but the scaling can also be changed 
dynamically at runtime to achieve some game effects (shrinking characters, 
dwarfs etc.). This property also automatically modifies the walking velocity.</p>
<p>Speaking of velocity, it's defined by the following two properties. The
<font color="#800000">VELOCITY</font> property specifies the walking speed, 
while <font color="#800000">ANGULAR_VELOCITY</font> specifies how fast the 
character turns.</p>
<p>Following section defines references to external files, <font color="#800000">
FONT</font> and <font color="#800000">CURSOR</font> properties are standard 
ones, <font color="#800000">MODEL</font> property is new to 3D characters. It 
should point to a MilkShape file (.ms3d).</p>
<p>The next few properties are dealing with character shadows. WME supports two 
types of shadows, simple and real-time. Simple shadow is a black &quot;blob&quot; below 
the character; real-time shadow is calculated at runtime and looks more 
realistic. You can choose whether to use shadows at all (the
<font color="#800000">SHADOW</font> property) and which type of shadow to use 
(the <font color="#800000">SIMPLE_SHADOW</font> property). Note that some older 
video cards don't support real-time shadows. In that case WME fill automatically 
fall back to simple shadows regardless this setting.</p>
<p>If you use real-time shadows, you can define the color of the shadow (this is 
usually unnecessary) and more importantly the position of the light source (<font color="#800000">LIGHT_POSITION</font>). 
This position is defined relatively to characters position and defines how long 
the shadow is and to which direction it's being cast. The property is defined by 
X, Y and Z coordinates of the light which casts the shadow. See the picture 
below for an example:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../img/shadow.png" width="190" height="296"></p>
<p><br>
<br>
If you use simple shadows, you will need the following two properties. The
<font color="#800000">SHADOW_SIZE</font> property defines the size of that black 
blob, while using the <font color="#800000">SHADOW_IMAGE</font> you can change 
its appearance. If you don't specify the shadow image, WME will use a default 
one. </p>
<p><br>
The last large section of the file defines all the animations the character 
provides. This is a big difference compared to 2D characters. Instead of several 
small animation files all the animations are predefined in the MS3D files and 
made accessible via this actor definition file. Each animation is defined by an
<font color="#800000">ANIMATION</font> block which contains several nested 
properties.</p>
<p>The animation properties start with name of the animation (<font color="#800000">NAME</font>). 
By using this name you can reference the animations later from game scripts when 
calling the <a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#PlayAnim">PlayAnim</a> 
method. There are few special names for animations, namely &quot;walk&quot;, &quot;idle&quot; and 
&quot;talk&quot;. These animations are used by the engine automatically.</p>
<p>The next property is called <font color="#800000">LOOPING</font>. It 
specifies whether this animation loops or plays only once.</p>
<p>The <font color="#800000">START_FRAME</font> and <font color="#800000">
END_FRAME</font> define the actual placement of this particular animation within 
the MilkShape file. You can have several animations in one file, and using these 
properties you can tell WME where does each animation start and end.</p>
<p>The second animation block in the example above contains an optional
<font color="#800000">MODEL</font> property. You can have various animations 
spread into several MilkShape files. In that case you have to specify in which 
file this particular animation is stored. Please note that only the bone 
animations are taken from these additional files, not the actual character 
model. Therefore you should use exactly the same skeleton in all files or you 
will get unpredictable results.</p>
<p>You can see the first animation block above contains two nested blocks named
<font color="#800000">EVENT</font>. Using these blocks you can trigger a script 
event whenever a certain frame of animation is played. Experienced WME users 
already know this from ordinary sprites. The example above specifies that frames 
4 and 16 trigger a script event called &quot;footstep&quot;. You can use these 
animation-triggered events in a script for various animation-dependent actions.<br>
