<h1>Actor definition file, X format</h1>

<p>Similarly to the ordinary actors, you define 3D actors by creating a simple 
definition files. These files use the .act3d extension and use the same syntax 
as other WME files. This is an example of a 3D actor definition file:</p>

<p>
<pre><font color="#800000">ACTOR3DX
{
  NAME = "trinity"
  CAPTION = "Trinity"
  INTERACTIVE = TRUE
  SCRIPT = "actors\trinity\trinity.script"

  SCALE = 180
  
  DROP_TO_FLOOR = TRUE

  ;--- velocities
  VELOCITY = 70.0
  ANGULAR_VELOCITY = 400.0

  ;--- external data
  MODEL = &quot;actors\trinity\trinity.x"
  FONT = "fonts\outline_red.font"  
  CURSOR = "sprites\arrow.sprite"
  
  SHADOW_MODEL = &quot;actors\trinity\trinity_low.x&quot;

  SHADOW_TYPE = &quot;stencil&quot;

  ;--- real-time shadow settings
  LIGHT_POSITION { -40, 200, -40 }
  SHADOW_COLOR { 0, 0, 0, 128 }

  ;--- simple shadow settings
  SHADOW_SIZE = 12.0
  SHADOW_IMAGE = "actors\trinity\shadow.png"
  
  ;--- effect files assignment
  EFFECT
  {
    MATERIAL = "chrome_buckle"
    EFFECT_FILE = "effects\shine.fx"
  }

  ;--- animation settings
  ANIMATION
  {
    NAME="idle"
    LOOPING=TRUE
  }


  ANIMATION
  {
    NAME="walk"
    LOOPING=TRUE

    EVENT
    {
      FRAME = 4
      NAME = "footstep"
    }

    EVENT
    {
      FRAME = 16
      NAME = "footstep"
    }
  }
}</font>

</pre>
Most of these properties are optional. WME tries to use reasonable default 
values for them.</p>

<p>The first block defines the usual properties, name, caption, interactivity 
and script assignment. You should already know these. If not, take a look at the
<a href="inside_actors.html">Actors chapter</a>.</p>
<p>The <font color="#800000">SCALE</font> property affects the overall scale of 
the character. You will typically use this property if your character model uses 
different scale than your scene models, but the scaling can also be changed 
dynamically at runtime to achieve some game effects (shrinking characters, 
dwarfs etc.). This property also automatically modifies the walking velocity.</p>
<p>The <span class="style1">DROP_TO_FLOOR</span> property specifies that the 
actor is always standing/walking on the walkplane, no matter what its original Y 
coordinate was. You may need to set this property to FALSE for things such as 
birds or butterflies.</p>
<p>Speaking of velocity, it's defined by the following two properties. The
<font color="#800000">VELOCITY</font> property specifies the walking speed, 
while <font color="#800000">ANGULAR_VELOCITY</font> specifies how fast the 
character turns.</p>
<p>Following section defines references to external files, <font color="#800000">
FONT</font> and <font color="#800000">CURSOR</font> properties are standard 
ones.</p>
<p> <font color="#800000">MODEL</font> property is new to 3D characters. It 
should point to a Microsoft X model file (.x). There can be multiple
<font color="#800000">MODEL</font> lines in the actor definition file. This 
allows you to merge animations from multiple files. Note: some 3D packages don't 
allow you to name animation sets in X files, they export nameless animation sets 
only (Blender, for example). In that case the animation name defaults to the 
name of the X file.</p>
<p>The next few properties are dealing with character <a href="3D_shadows.html">shadows</a>. WME supports 
several types of shadows. Using the <font color="#800000">SHADOW_TYPE </font>
property you specify which type of shadow should be used by this actor. This 
property can be assigned the following values: &quot;none&quot;, &quot;simple&quot;, &quot;flat&quot; or 
&quot;stencil&quot;. The default value is &quot;stencil&quot;.</p>
<p><a name="light"></a>If you use flat shadows or stencil shadows, you can define the color of the shadow (this is 
usually unnecessary) and more importantly the position of the light source (<font color="#800000">LIGHT_POSITION</font>). 
This position is defined relatively to characters position and defines how long 
the shadow is and to which direction it's being cast. The property is defined by 
X, Y and Z coordinates of the light which casts the shadow. See the picture 
below for an example:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../img/shadow.png" width="190" height="296"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><br>
<br>
If you use simple shadows, you will need the following two properties. The
<font color="#800000">SHADOW_SIZE</font> property defines the size of that black 
blob, while using the <font color="#800000">SHADOW_IMAGE</font> you can change 
its appearance. If you don't specify the shadow image, WME will use a default 
one. Please make sure you specify proper shadow size even if you don't 
explicitly use simple shadows. Remember that WME can fall back to simple shadows 
if user's hardware doesn't support flat or stencil shadows.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The optional <font color="#800000">SHADOW_MODEL</font> property 
specifies a special low-polygon version of the character model. This model is 
used for generating stencil shadows. If your character model is very detailed, 
you'll need to create a low-poly shadow model, otherwise stencil shadows would 
reduce the performance of your game. Note that the low-poly model must use <b>
exactly</b> the same bone structure as your main character mode.</p>
<p><br>
The last large section of the file deals with the animations. This is a big difference compared to 2D characters. Instead of several 
small animation files all the animations are predefined in the X files. Each X 
file can contain one or more animation sets. For example, your actor's X model 
could contain animation sets called &quot;walk&quot; and &quot;idle&quot;. By using this name you can reference the animations later from game scripts when 
calling the <a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#PlayAnim">PlayAnim</a> 
method. There are few special (reserved) names for standard animations, namely &quot;Walk&quot;, &quot;Idle&quot;, 
&quot;Talk&quot;, &quot;TurnLeft&quot; and &quot;TurnRight&quot;. These animations are used by the engine automatically.</p>
<p>The <span class="style1">EFFECT</span> blocks allow you to assign effect 
files (advanced material definitions, described <a href="inside_effects.html">
here</a>) to sub-meshes of the actor model. You 
define the sub-mesh material name (<span class="style1">MATERIAL</span>) and the effect file to be assigned 
to this sub-mesh (<span class="style1">EFFECT_FILE</span>). 
The material name defaults to the name of the texture assigned to given sub-mesh 
(without path or extension). For example, if the 
head of your actor model uses texture called &quot;textures\joe_head.png&quot;, the 
sub-mesh is internally called &quot;joe_head&quot;.</p>
<p>You can specify multiple <span class="style1">EFFECT</span> blocks, if you 
need to assign effect files to several sub-meshes of the actor model, but any of 
the <span class="style1">EFFECT</span> blocks must be placed AFTER the
<span class="style1">MODEL</span> definitions.</p>
<p><a name="animations"></a>The
<font color="#800000">ANIMATION</font> blocks in the actor definition files 
allow you to define additional options for these animation sets. Note that the 
animation definitions are optional (unlike the previous WME versions using the 
MS3D format).</p>
<p>The animation properties start with name of the animation (<font color="#800000">NAME</font>). 
The name specifies the animation set whose properties you're going to set. </p>
<p>The next property is called <font color="#800000">LOOPING</font>. It 
specifies whether this animation loops or plays only once. Some 3D modeling 
packages can export the &quot;looping&quot; information directly to X files, some can not. 
In the latter case you will need to specify the <font color="#800000">LOOPING</font> property in the actor 
definition file. </p>
<p>You can see the first animation block above contains two nested blocks named
<font color="#800000">EVENT</font>. Using these blocks you can trigger a script 
event whenever a certain frame of animation is played. Experienced WME users 
already know this from ordinary sprites. The example above specifies that frames 
4 and 16 trigger a script event called &quot;footstep&quot;. You can use these 
animation-triggered events in a script for various animation-dependent actions.<br>
</p>
<p>There is a semi-experimental support for collision detection between multiple 
actors. It's only supported for scenes using the &quot;2D pathfinding&quot; option and the 
function is exactly the same as for 2D actors (described
<a href="inside_actors.html#collisions">here</a>). So to recap, you need to add 
the <span class="style1">BLOCKED_REGION</span> and <span class="style1">
WAYPOINTS</span> sections to the 3D actor definition file, and the scene must be 
configured to use 2D-based pathfinding. Please note that the private blocked 
region is scaled automatically according to scene scale level in the point where 
the actor is standing. Therefore it might be necessary to define scale levels 
for your scene, even though normally it's not needed for 3D characters.</p>
