<h2>Working with the inventory</h2>
<p>Most adventure games use so-called inventory, i.e. the place where the player 
character stores all the item he has in his possession. Creating and 
manipulating the inventory in WME takes several steps, which we will describe in 
this chapter.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#inventory_box">Inventory box</a></li>
	<li><a href="#items">Items definition</a></li>
  <li><a href="#scripting">Using the inventory from scripts</a></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="inventory_box"></a>Inventory box</h3>
<p>The inventory box defines the design of your inventory window. It can be 
edited interactively using the <a href="windowedit.html">WindowEdit</a> tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="items"></a>Items definition</h3>
<p>All the inventory items must be defined in a definition file (by default it's 
called &quot;items.items&quot;). This file has contain a section for each item you'll ever 
use in your game. The definition looks like this:</p>
<pre><font color="#800000">ITEM
{   
   CAPTION = "Item caption"
   NAME = "item_name"

   SPRITE = "items\normal_image.bmp"
   SPRITE_HOVER = "items\hover_image.bmp"

   CURSOR = "items\normal_cursor.bmp"
   CURSOR_HOVER = "items\hover_cursor.bmp"
   CURSOR_COMBINED = TRUE

   ALPHA = 255
   ALPHA_COLOR { 255, 255, 255 }

   TALK = "items\item_talking.sprite"
   FONT = "fonts\some.font"

   SCRIPT = "items\item.script"

   AMOUNT = 100
   DISPLAY_AMOUNT = FALSE
   AMOUNT_ALIGN = right
   AMOUNT_OFFSET_X = 5
   AMOUNT_OFFSET_Y = 47
}</font>
</pre>
Description:
<ul>
  <li>CAPTION - a description of the item</li>
  <li>NAME - internal name of the item, you reference the item in scripts by 
  this name</li>
  <li>SPRITE - the image/animation representing the item</li>
  <li>SPRITE_HOVER - image/anbimation to be displayed then the player moves 
  mouse pointer above the item</li>
  <li>CURSOR - an image to be used as mouse cursor when the item is selected</li>
  <li>CURSOR_HOVER - an image to be used as mouse cursor when the item is 
  selected and is over an active object</li>
  <li>CURSOR_COMBINED - specifies it the item cursor should be displayed 
  together with standard cursor</li>
  <li>ALPHA - specifies the transparency of the item image (0 - completely 
  transparent, 255 - opaque)</li>
  <li>ALPHA_COLOR - specifies the RGB color of the item image</li>
  <li>TALK - the talking animation for this item</li>
  <li>FONT - which font should be used for talk subtitles and amount display</li>
  <li>SCRIPT - a script file defining the item behavior</li>
  <li>AMOUNT - current amount of items</li>
  <li>DISPLAY_AMOUNT - should the current amount be displayed?</li>
  <li>AMOUNT_ALIGN - the alignment of the amount label (&quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot; or 
  &quot;center&quot;)</li>
  <li>AMOUNT_OFFSET_X - the X offset of the amount label relative to item's 
  position</li>
  <li>AMOUNT_OFFSET_Y - the Y offset of the amount label relative to item's 
  position</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the above attributes are optional. Basically you only need to define 
NAME and SPRITE, possibly also CAPTION and SCRIPT.</p>
<p>You will need to add a similar section for each of your inventory items to 
the items definition file.</p>
<p>As you can see, items can hold the information about the amount. This is 
useful for items like &quot;money&quot;, which can use the amount property for storing how 
much money the player has, or for RPG-style games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="scripting"></a>Using the inventory from scripts</h3>
<p>Once we have our inventory box and items defined, we can start using them 
throughout the game, i.e. in the scripts. Note that all the script methods and 
attributes discussed in this chapter are described in detail in the
<a href="scripting_ref.html">Script langue reference</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Taking, dropping, destroying and querying items</b></p>
<p>You generally reference inventory items by their name. If you want to take an 
item into inventory, use the <b>
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_game.html#TakeItem">Game.TakeItem()</a></b>, for example:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber2">
  <tr>
    <td class="code">
<pre>Game.TakeItem("book");
</pre>    
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>This will add the &quot;book&quot; item into inventory. If you are using multiple 
inventories, you'll need to call the TakeItem method on the actual object you 
want to take the item, for example OldGuy.TakeItem(&quot;book&quot;);</p>
<p>Removing item from inventory works in a similar fashion. Only use the <b>
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_game.html#DropItem">Game.DropItem()</a></b> method instead:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber3">
  <tr>
    <td class="code">
<pre>Game.DropItem("book");
</pre>    
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>This command will remove the item from inventory. Although the inventory item 
is no longer displayed in the inventory, it may be reused later. If you want to 
remove the item from the game permanently, use the <b>
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_game.html#DropItem">Game.DeleteItem()</a></b> 
method.</p>
<p>You can query a taken item using the <b>
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_game.html#GetItem">Game.GetItem()</a></b> method. It will return 
an item object which can be used to set item's attributes.</p>
<p>To query if a certain object is taken by some game object, use the <b>
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_game.html#IsItemTaken">Game.IsItemTaken()</a></b> method. It will search the inventories of all game 
objects to see if one of them has the item taken. On the other hand, the game 
objects provide a <b><a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor.html#HasItem">HasItem()</a></b> method, which you can use to ask one concrete 
object if he has the item.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber4">
  <tr>
    <td class="code">
<pre>// has anyone the book?
var IsBookTaken = Game.IsItemTaken("book");

// has OldGuy the book?
var OldGuyHasBook = OldGuy.HasItem("book");
</pre>    
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Assigning inventory items to scene objects</b></p>
<p>It is very common that there are object within the scene, which can be taken. 
Once taken, they disappear from the scene. It is very easy in WME to connect an 
inventory item with a scene object. Let's assume we have a scene entity 
representing book, and an inventory item named &quot;book&quot;. Once the item is taken, 
we want the scene entity to disappear. In SceneEdit, select the entity 
representing item and look at the properties pane. You'll see an &quot;Item&quot; field 
there. Simply fill-in the name of the inventory item you want to assign to this 
entity:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../img/item_assignment.png" width="260" height="243"></p>
<p>The &quot;book&quot; entity is now assigned to the &quot;book&quot; inventory item. It means that 
once you call <b>Game.TakeItem(&quot;book&quot;);</b> from a script, the entity will 
automatically disappear. Analogically, once you drop the item using <b>
Game.DropItem(&quot;book&quot;);</b> the entity will automatically reappear. If you want 
to permanently remove the item and the entity, just call <b>
Game.DeleteItem(&quot;book&quot;);</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Selecting items</b></p>
<p>If the player selects an inventory item, the mouse pointer will change 
appropriately. If the item pointer is moved over an interactive object, the 
item's &quot;hover cursor&quot; is painted, otherwise the &quot;normal cursor&quot; is used (see 
above). To make an inventory item selected, use the <b>Game.SelectedItem</b> 
property. To deselect an item, set this attribute to <b>null</b>.</p>
<p>If you don't want the hover effects to be displayed when the mouse pointer is 
over an object which cannot respond to a currently selected item, set the <b>
Game.SmartItemCursor</b> property to <b>true</b>. This property simply checks if 
the object under mouse can handle an event with the name of the currently 
selected item. Note that this property only affects the mouse pointer 
appearance, it doesn't prevent the player from actually using the item on the 
scene object. This needs to be handled in your game scripts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Multiple inventories</b></p>
<p>In WME each object (game, actors, entities) can have its own private 
inventory. It's mainly useful for games with multiple main characters. In that 
case you can control whose inventory is currently displayed on screen. This is 
done by setting the <b>Game.InventoryObject</b> attribute. By default this 
attribute is set to the Game object, which is just fine for single-inventory 
games. If you have multiple switching actors you'll want to set this attribute 
to the current actor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Querying available inventory items</b></p>
<p>Sometimes it's useful to be able to traverse through all the inventory items 
defined in game. The <b>Game.TotalNumItems</b> attribute returns the number of 
all inventory items (taken or otherwise) and the <b>
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_game.html#QueryItem">Game.QueryItem()</a></b> 
method allows you to query one specific item. The following code sample 
traverses through all defined inventory items and displays their name on screen:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber5">
  <tr>
    <td class="code">
<pre>for(var i=0; i&lt;Game.TotalNumItems; i=i+1)
{
  var Item = Game.QueryItem(i);
  Game.Msg(Item.Name);
}
</pre>    
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
