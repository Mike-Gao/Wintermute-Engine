<h2>Scene creation step by step (tutorial)</h2>
<p>The scenes are the “rooms” of your game. 
Adventure games usually consist of many scenes, and the main character walks 
from one scene to another.</p>
<p>Designing a scene is a very important 
and complex task and it might be a bit confusing for a beginner. That’s why I 
decided to describe the scene creating process in a form of a step by step 
tutorial. Be sure to read this chapter very carefully. If you want to be a 
successful WME developer, it’s extremely important that you understand the 
concepts of a scene design.</p>

<p>Note: This tutorial focuses mainly on 2D games. However, most of the concepts 
apply to 2.5D games as well. The scene design process is exactly the same, but 
you will need to specify some additional options to support 3D characters 
properly. 3D character support is discussed in great detail is
