<h2>The basics</h2>

<p>WME plugin support is designed to fit the object-oriented nature of WME 
scripting. That means each plugin can provide one or more scripting &quot;classes&quot;, 
which can be then used from scripts. Scripts can create objects of these 
classes, call their methods and set/get their attributes, similarly to the 
built-in WME classes, such as <a href="generated/scripting_ref_file.html">File</a> 
or <a href="generated/scripting_ref_string.html">String</a>.</p>

<p>For example, the sample &quot;wme_snow.dll&quot; plugin provides a new scripting class 
called &quot;Snow&quot;. Whenever this plugin is present in the WME directory, the scripts can create objects 
of the &quot;Snow&quot; class and access their methods and properties, like this:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber2">
  <tr>
    <td class="code">
<pre>var SnowGen = new Snow(100);
SnowGen.Run();
</pre>    

</table>
<p>Internally, both the constructor and the method call are routed to the plugin 
DLL. WME only manages the interface between the scripts and the plugins.</p>
<p>The following chapters describe the interface each plugin has to provide to 
be usable that way. Be sure to check the <a href="plugins_samples.html">samples</a> 
as well, they should help you to better understand the principles.</p>
