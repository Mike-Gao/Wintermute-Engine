<h3><a name="windows"></a>Windows</h3>
<p>The windows are the base of all GUI elements in WME. Imagine a window as a 
rectangular area on screen, which can can contain one or more other controls 
(buttons, editors...) including other (nested) windows. The windows can be 
completely &quot;skinned&quot;, i.e. you can change their appearance to fit your game's 
look and feel.</p>

<p>You define a window by writing a simple text file. The window files use the 
.window extension. Let's have a look at an 
example of a window definition file. First there is a file header followed by 
general window properties. There are lots of possible properties, you don't need 
to use all of them, most properties use a reasonable default if you don't define 
them. Basically, only define properties you need to change and ignore the 
others.</p>

<pre><font color="#800000">WINDOW

  NAME = "MyWindow"
  TEMPLATE = "templates\MyTemplate.window"

</pre>
<p>Description:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NAME - the internal name of this window</li>
  <li>TEMPLATE - a reference to another .window file; if you have lots of 
  similar windows, you can move all common properties to a separate file and 
  reference it as a template. It's a good idea to put the template reference 
  early in the definition, so that you can override inherited properties if 
  needed.</li>
  <li>X, Y - the initial position of the window</li>
  <li>WIDTH, HEIGHT - the size of the window</li>
  <li>VISIBLE - specifies whether the window is initially visible</li>
  <li>DISABLED - specifies whether the window is initially disabled</li>
  <li>TITLE - the title caption of this window</li>
  <li>TITLE_RECT - specifies the rectangle within the window where the caption 
  will be placed. The rectangle is defined by four numbers: left, top, right and 
  bottom (in pixels).</li>
  <li>TITLE_ALIGN - specifies the alignment of the caption, the possible values 
  are: left, right or center.</li>
  <li>DRAG_RECT - specifies the rectangle within the window which can be dragged 
  by mouse. The rectangle is defined by four numbers: left, top, right and 
  bottom (in pixels).</li>
  <li>BACK - specifies a tiled image to be used as a background image of this 
  window (<a href="#tiled_images">learn more about tiled images</a>)</li>
  <li>BACK_INACTIVE - specifies a tiled image to be used as a background image 
  of this window when the window is inactive (<a href="#tiled_images">learn more about tiled images</a>)</li>

  (<a href="inside_sprites.html">learn more about sprites</a>)</li>
  <li>IMAGE_INACTIVE - specifies a sprite to be used as a background image of 
  this window when the window is inactive (<a href="inside_sprites.html">learn

  <li>FONT - the font file to be used to display window title</li>
  <li>FONT_INACTIVE - the font file to be used to display window title when the 
  window is inactive</li>
  <li>CURSOR - the sprite file to be used as a mouse cursor when mouse is over this window</li>
  <li>SCRIPT - the script file containing the logic of this window (there can be 
  multiple SCRIPT lines in the window definition)</li>
  <li>TRANSPARENT - the window marked as transparent doesn't receive click 
  events, all the mouse clicks go through</li>
  <li>MENU - the window marked as a menu does automatically disappear when the 
  player clicks outside the window</li>
  <li>IN_GAME - the window marked as in-game is displayed before the inventory 
  window; otherwise the windows are displayed after the inventory</li>
  <li>CLIP_CONTENTS - this attribute specifies whether the controls contained in 
  the window are clipped if they overlap the window rectangle</li>
  <li>FADE_COLOR - if the window is displayed the background will be covered by 
  the specified color; the color is defined as three numbers for red, green and 
  blue color components</li>
  <li>FADE_ALPHA - specifies the opacity of the color defined by the FADE_COLOR 
  attribute; it ranges from 0 (completely transparent) to 255 (completely 
  opaque)</li>
  <li>PAUSE_MUSIC - specifies if the window should pause music when entering the system exlusive mode
  opaque)</li>
</ul>
<p>After those general properties the window definition contains embedded 
definitions of the controls to be placed on this window. For example the 
following definition will place a button on our window. The controls definitions 
are described in detail later in this chapter. Note that windows can contain 
other windows in them.</p>

<p>For an example of a complete window definition please see the &quot;WME demo&quot;

you don't need to write the definition file from scratch, there is a window

<h3><a name="buttons"></a>Buttons</h3>

<p>Buttons in WME can have various appearances. They can be either graphical or 
rectangular with a text label, or a combination of those. As in the case of 
windows and other controls, the buttons can be &quot;skinned&quot; to fit your game's 
appearance.</p>

<p>Button definitions are always part of the .window file (see above).  Let's have a look at an

<h3><a name="entity_containers"></a>Entity containers</h3>
<p>The entity container is a special control, which allows you to incorporate 
advanced interactive object (an entity) to your GUI layout. This way you can 
have &quot;intelligent&quot; objects placed on your windows. The possible usages are for 
example a Runaway style inventory window (with a talking animated character) or 
items close-ups (<a href="inside_entites.html">learn more about entities</a>).</p>

<h3><a name="tiled_images"></a>Tiled images</h3>
<p>Although you can specify an image (sprite) as a background for windows and 
controls, the image always has a fixed size. Sometimes it's useful to specify a 
special kind of image which can be &quot;stretched&quot; when needed. This way you can use 
the same background for windows/controls with variable size. There special 
images are called &quot;tiled images&quot;.</p>
<p>The tiled image consist of a picture and a definition file.&nbsp; The 
definition file specifies the &quot;tiles&quot; within the picture. When the engine needs 
to resize the image, it uses those tiles and repeats them until the need size is 
matched.</p>
<p>For example the following definition divides the picture into nine tiles of 
30x30 pixels.</p>

<pre><font color="#800000">TILED_IMAGE
{
  IMAGE="ui_elements\win.bmp"
  VERTICAL_TILES {30, 30, 30}
  HORIZONTAL_TILES {30, 30, 30}
}</font>
</pre>
<p>And this is the resulting tiled image:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../img/tiled_image.png" width="100" height="100"></p>
<p>Of course, if you use a tiled image as a background for your 
windows/controls, you can only set the size to multiplies of the tile size.</p>
