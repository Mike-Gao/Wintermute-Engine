<h3>Calling external DLL libraries from WME scripts</h3>
<p>(Note: this functionality is aimed at advanced users with programming 
experience)</p>
<h4>Declaration</h4>
<p>WME allows your scripts to call external functions from DLL libraries. 
This way you can either call Win32 API functions or write your own extension DLL 
libraries (plug-ins).</p>
<p>To use an external function from a script you must &quot;declare&quot; it first. The 
declaration syntax is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>external &quot;dll_name&quot; [calling_convention] [return_type] 
  function_name ( [parameters] );</b></p>
  <p>(components enclosed in square brackets are optional)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>dll_name</i> - The name of the DLL library, enclosed in quotes. It can 
also contain a relative or absolute path (not recommended). Please refer to the 
WIN32 API documentation for the information on how Windows searches for a DLL 
library.</p>
<p><i>calling_convention</i> - This specifies which calling convention does the 
specified function use. It can be either <font face="Courier New">stdcall</font> 
or <font face="Courier New">cdecl</font>. If you don't specify a calling 
convention, WME uses stdcall by default. The stdcall convention is used by Win32 
API, while your custom DLL library written in C/C++ will probably use cdecl 
convention. Please refer to you compiler documentation for more information 
about calling conventions.</p>
<p><i>return_type</i> - Specifies a data type of the value returned by the 
function. If the function doesn't return a value (its return type is <b>void</b>) 
or if you don't want to use its return value, you don't need to specify any 
return type. See below for the list of supported data types.</p>
<p><i>function_name</i> - This is the name of the function as exported by the 
DLL library. It must match the name <i>exactly</i> otherwise WME will fail to 
call the function.<br>
&nbsp;- Note 1: If you are using C++ to write your DLL, be sure to declare your 
function as <font face="Courier New">extern &quot;C&quot;</font> otherwise your DLL will 
export a &quot;decorated&quot; C++ name.<br>
&nbsp;- Note 2: If you are declaring a Win32 API function, remember that all 
functions working with strings are provided in two variations, ANSI and Unicode. 
Thus Windows DLLs export two functions: FunctionNameA (for ANSI) and 
FunctionNameW (for Unicode). WME currently doesn't support Unicode, therefore 
you must use the &quot;A&quot; (ANSI) functions.</p>
<p><i>parameters</i> - This is the list of parameters delimited by commas. 
Parameters are defined by their types followed (optionally) by their names. You 
don't need to specify parameter names, they are not used for anything. See below 
for the list of supported data types.</p>
<h4>Data types</h4>
<p>WME only allows you to pass primitive types to the DLL functions. While WME 
script uses untyped variables, they are converted to a requested primitive data 
type when passed to a DLL function.</p>
<p>Supported data types are:</p>
<table id="AutoNumber1" style="BORDER-COLLAPSE: collapse" borderColor="#111111" cellSpacing="1" border="2">
  <tr>
    <td style="font-size: 68%">int</td>
    <td style="font-size: 68%">32 bit integer number, equivalent to int, long or 
    DWORD </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="font-size: 68%">bool</td>
    <td style="font-size: 68%">logical value, true or false</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="font-size: 68%">byte</td>
    <td style="font-size: 68%">8 bit value, equivalent to BYTE or unsigned char</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="font-size: 68%">string</td>
    <td style="font-size: 68%">array of 8 bit characters, equivalent to char* 
    or LPSTR or LPCSTR (see below)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="font-size: 68%">float</td>
    <td style="font-size: 68%">32 bit floating-point value, equivalent to float 
    of FLOAT</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="font-size: 68%">double</td>
    <td style="font-size: 68%">64 bit floating-point value, equivalent to double</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="font-size: 68%">membuffer</td>
    <td style="font-size: 68%">32 bit memory pointer value; it must be 
    represented by WME's <a href="generated/scripting_ref_membuffer.html">
    MemBuffer</a> object</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>You can also use <i>short</i> and <i>long</i> data types, they are synonymous 
to <i>int</i>.</p>
<p>Strings in WME scripts have variable length, dependent on the value they 
currently contain. But some DLL functions are able to return you a string value 
into a provided buffer of a fixed size. In this case you can't use ordinary 
string variables, but you must construct a String object and specify the 
requested buffer size:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td bgColor="#ccffff" style="font-size: 68%">
    <pre>var MyFixedString = new String(256); // this will create a 255 characters long string buffer
</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Note: You can query string buffer size using the string object's <b>Capacity</b> 
attribute. </p>
<h4>DLL internal data</h4>
<p>When WME calls an external DLL function, it only loads the DLL immediately 
before the call and unloads the DLL immediately after. Therefore the DLL cannot 
hold any internal data between subsequent calls to its functions, because they 
would be lost after unloading the library. This can be overcome by explicitly 
loading your DLL from a script using the LoadLibraryA API function and keeping 
it loaded all the time, but you must remember that the player can save/load game 
at anytime, therefore your loaded DLL can get unloaded anyway. You can use 
game's <b>BeforeSave</b> and <b>AfterLoad</b> events to store/restore private 
data before saving and after loading game.</p>
<h4>Passing structures to/from DLL functions</h4>
<p>Some of the API functions and possibly your own DLL functions may require 
passing structures to them. WME provides a built-in <b>MemBuffer</b> object type 
for this purpose. By creating a MemBuffer object in a script you reserve a 
memory space which can be then passed to a DLL function. MemBuffer objects 
provide a number of methods for writing/reading values of different types 
to/from them thus simulating the &quot;struct&quot; keyword known from some other 
programming languages. See the <a href="generated/scripting_ref_membuffer.html">
MemBuffer scripting reference</a> for more details.</p>
<h4>A word of warning</h4>
<p>By using external DLL functions, you are skating on a thin ice. While 
normally WME tries to catch developer's mistakes to prevent fatal errors and 
crashes, using the external functions you can crash the engine quite easily. 
Keep this in mind and be very careful about the passed parameters, their order 
and about the calling convention.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>The following example demonstrates declaring and calling several Win32 API 
functions from a WME script.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td bgColor="#ccffff" style="font-size: 68%">
    <pre>// declaration
external &quot;user32.dll&quot; MessageBeep(int uType);
external &quot;kernel32.dll&quot; long GetTempPathA(int nBufferLength, string lpBuffer);
external &quot;kernel32.dll&quot; int LoadLibraryA(string);
external &quot;kernel32.dll&quot; FreeLibrary(int);

function MyDllTest()
{
  // MessageBeep plays a sound
  MessageBeep(0);
  
  // GetTempPath returns the Windows' temporary folder
  var TempPath = new String(256);
  GetTempPathA(TempPath.Capacity, TempPath);
  Game.Msg(&quot;Windows temporary folder is: &quot; + TempPath);

  // load our custom DLL and unload it immediately
  var hDll = LoadLibraryA(&quot;MyDll.dll&quot;);
  FreeLibrary(hDll);
}</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
