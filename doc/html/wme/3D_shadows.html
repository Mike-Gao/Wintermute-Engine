<h1>Shadows</h1>

<p>WME supports several types of shadows for 3D characters. The shadow types 
differ in their visual fidelity and hardware requirements.</p>

<h2>Shadow types</h2>

<h3>No shadows</h3>

<p>This is, of course, the simplest case, shadows are completely disabled. You 
may need to disable shadows under certain circumstances, for example when your 
character is lying on the bed you probably won't need to display shadows.</p>

<h3>Simple shadows</h3>

<p>This is sort of a &quot;last resort&quot; type of shadow. It's always available and 
doesn't impose any hardware or performance requirements. You can change the 
shadow image using the
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#SetShadowImage">SetShadowImage()</a> 
method.</p>

<p>

<h3>Flat shadows</h3>

<p>Flat shadows are projected onto a fictional flat plane at the character's 
feet. You can specify the shape and direction of the shadow by specifying a 
position of a <a href="3D_actors_x.html#light">fictional light</a> casting it. This can be done using the
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#SetLightPosition">
SetLightPosition()</a> method. You can also change the color of the shadow using 
the <b>ShadowColor</b> property.</p>

<p>Flat shadows are not available on some older video cards. If the engine 
detects flat shadows are unavailable, it falls back to simple shadows.</p>

<p>Flat shadows impose a small performance loss, because the character model 
needs to be rendered twice; once for the shadow silhouette and once for the 
scene display itself.</p>

<h3>Stencil shadows</h3>

<p>Stencil shadows are the most advanced type of shadows. Similarly to flat 
shadows they're cast by a fictional light source, but unlike the flat shadow 
they are projected onto the hidden scene geometry. That means the shadows are 
realistically bending on the walls, furniture etc.</p>

<p>Similarly to flat shadows you can affect the shadow shape and direction by 
changing the light source position using the
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor3d.html#SetLightPosition">SetLightPosition()</a> 
method and you can change its color by setting the <b>ShadowColor</b> property.</p>

<p>To use stencil shadows, the scene must be designed to support them. Your 
hidden scene geometry must include relatively detailed model of the scene 
objects receiving shadows, which is not required for the other shadow types. See
<a href="3D_principles.html">this chapter</a> for more information about hidden 
scene geometry.</p>

<p>Stencil shadows are the most hardware demanding type of shadows. They use 
both CPU and rendering power of the computer, especially for very detailed 
character models. For this reason WME allows you to specify a special 
low-polygon model of the character for stencil shadow processing purposes. This 
simplified character model is specified in <a href="3D_actors_x.html">3D actor 
definition file</a>. It must use <b>exactly</b> the same bone structure as your 
main character model, because they share the same animations.</p>

<h2>Limiting shadow type availability</h2>

<p>It is sometimes desirable to limit shadow type support to certain detail 
level. For example, you can let the user choose detail level depending on their 
computer configuration, or you may need to only allow certain shadow type in 
certain scenes (for example, scenes which don't have detailed hidden geometry 
will be limited to flat shadows, some scenes don't need shadows at all, etc.).</p>

<p>To limit the maximum available shadow type for the entire game, use the <b>
Game.MaxShadowType</b> attribute. This attribute can be assigned numbers 0 (no 
shadows), 1 (simple shadows), 2 (flat shadows) or 3 (stencil shadows). If you 
try to assign shadow type unsupported on current hardware, the engine will fall 
back to the next lower available shadow type. To check whether certain shadow 
type is supported or not, use the <b>
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_game.html#IsShadowTypeSupported">
Game.IsShadowTypeSupported()</a></b> method.</p>

<p>To limit the maximum available shadow type for a certain scene, use the <b>
Scene.MaxShadowType</b> attribute. This value can be interactively assigned in 
SceneEdit when designing scene, using the <a href="3D_additional.html">
Additional 3D options tab</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can specify shadow type individually for each 3D actor 
setting their <b>ShadowType</b> attribute.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> You cannot mix stencil shadows with other shadow types in a 
single scene. Once stencil shadows are enabled for a scene, all the actors must 
use them. If you attempt to use flat or simple shadows in scene with stencil 
shadow support enabled, you'll get graphical artifacts.</p>
