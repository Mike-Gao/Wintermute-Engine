<h2>Sprites</h2>

<p>Sprites are the basic graphics elements used by WME. A &quot;sprite&quot; can be either 
a normal static image or an animation. While a normal image can be created by 
any graphics editor program, the animated sprites are more complicated to 
create. Basically, the animated sprite is a set of one or more images. Those 
images change in specified interval thus forming an animation.</p>

<p>WME Development Kit includes a tool for creating animated sprites; this tool 
is called <b>SpriteEdit</b>. The SpriteEdit tool allows you to assemble a bunch 
of single images (animation frames) into one animation and setting several 
additional properties. You can also assign sounds to individual frames of the 
animation.</p>

<p>One animation frame is not limited to a single image. You can compose one 
frame of multiple images (they are then called the &quot;<b>subframes</b>&quot;). You 
don't usually need to use subframes, but they can be useful sometimes. For 
example let's assume you have an animation of a walking man. Now you want the man to 
wear a hat. Instead of redrawing all the animation frames, you can draw just the 
hat and add it as a subframe to all the animation frames. Of course this is not 
a good example, but you may find a more creative use for the subframes.</p>

<p>The easiest way of creating a new sprite is to use the template facility of 
the ProjectMan (<a href="inside_projectman.html#creating_objects">read more</a>), 
but you can as well build a new sprite from scratch by creating a new file in 
SpriteEdit.</p>

<p>SpriteEdit can be invoked either by double-clicking a sprite file in 
ProjectMan or by clicking the SpriteEdit icon in the WME Development Kit program 
group in the Windows Start menu.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SpriteEdit interface</h3>

<p>The user interface of the SpriteEdit tool is very straightforward. The 
&quot;sprite bar&quot; on the left side displays information about your animation and 
allows you to change its properties.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="../img/SpriteEdit1.png" width="220" height="115"></p>

<p>This toolbar allows you to change position within a sprite, or test your 
animation (the &quot;Play&quot; button). You can reorder the animation frames or subframes 
using the green arrows. The <b>Looping</b> check-box specifies whether the animation 
loops, i.e. after displaying the last frame the animation won't stop, but rather 
skip back to the beginning.</p>

<p>The last set of buttons allows you to add frames and subframes or remove them 
respectively.</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111">
<tr>
  <td>
    <p align="center"><img src="../img/hint.png" width="23" height="30"><br><b>Hint</b>
  </td>
  <td>
    You can select multiple files in the &quot;Add frame(s)&quot; file selection dialog.&nbsp;
  </td>
</table>

<p>Below the toolbar you can see a list of all frames your animation consists 
of.</p>

<p>The &quot;Frame properties&quot; toolbar allows you to change settings for each 
animation frame (or subframe). </p>

<p><img border="0" src="../img/SpriteEdit2.png" width="231" height="301"></p>

<ul>
  <li>

<b>Delay</b> - specifies a time duration of the selected frame (in milliseconds)</li>
  <li>
<b>Move by</b> - the sprite can move its owner (actor or entity); if you fill in 
the &quot;move by&quot; values, every time this frame is displayed, the owning object will 
move by a specified amount of pixels. For example actors' walking sprites use 
this function.</li>
  <li><b>Sound</b> - you can assign sound files to animation frames</li>
  <li>
<b>Event</b> - individual animation frames can trigger a script event in their 
owning object; it's useful when you need to synchronize certain script action 
with an animation (for example playing footstep sounds)</li>
  <li><b>Keyframe</b> - not 
used yet</li>
  <li><b>Kill sounds</b> - whenever this frame is displayed, all the 
sounds played by previous frames are stopped</li>
  <li><b>3D only / 2D only</b> - specifies whether this subframe should only be 
  displayed when the game runs in accelerated mode or non-accelerated mode 
  respectively. This way you can optimize your sprites for both the accelerated 
  and non-accelerated mode if you need to. For example you can add a shadow 
  subframe, which will be half-transparent. But it would look bad in 
  non-accelerated mode. Therefore by checking the &quot;3D Only&quot; check-box you can 
  disable the shadows for non-accelerated mode.</li>
  <li><b>Image</b> - the image to be displayed in this subframe.</li>
  <li><b>Hot spot</b> - the &quot;hot spot&quot; specifies the base point of the subframe, 
  i.e. the point from which the image will be drawn. For example in case of 
  walking character animation you will want to place the hot spot at the 
  character's feet so that you can set its position conveniently. You can change 
  the hot spot easily by dragging the image in the right&nbsp; window.</li>
  <li><b>Transparent</b> - specifies a color which will be treated as 
  &quot;transparent&quot; by the engine. It defaults to the pink color (RGB(255, 0, 255)) 
  because that color is rarely used in the graphics itself.</li>
  <li><b>Alpha color / Opacity</b> - specifies the color shade and opacity of 
  the current subframe. This setting only applies in accelerated mode.</li>
  <li><b>Decoration subframe</b> - A subframe marked as &quot;decoration&quot; will appear 
  as non-interactive when the player moves the mouse pointer over it. It is 
  useful for example for shadows; you want them to be displayed on screen but 
  you don't want the player to be able to click on them.</li>
</ul>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111">
<tr>
  <td>
    <p align="center"><img src="../img/hint.png" width="23" height="30"><br><b>Hint</b>
  </td>
  <td>
    Some properties can by copied to all frames at once by pressing the &quot;Apply 
    to all frames&quot; buttons.&nbsp;
  </td>
</table>



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By selecting the &quot;Properties&quot; tab on the sprite bar, you can change 
properties of the entire animation.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../img/SpriteEdit3.png" width="219" height="331"></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Name</b> - specifies the internal name of this animation</li>
  <li><b>Looping</b> - specifies whether this is a looping animation (same 
  setting as on the first page, it's duplicated for better conveninece)</li>
  <li><b>Continuous</b> - the &quot;continuous&quot; animation cannot be interrupted in 
  the middle (not used in WME)</li>
  <li><b>Pixel precise</b> - specifies whether this animation uses 
  &quot;pixel-prefect&quot; mouse-over detection when it's used to display an interactive 
  object. If not set,&nbsp; the entire rectangle appears as interactive.</li>
  <li><b>Streaming animation</b> - the animation isn't stored in memory, rather 
  the frames are loaded from disk when needed. Useful for long slow animations.</li>
  <li><b>Mute sounds</b> - design only setting; it allows you to disable sounds 
  in the SpriteEdit while editing this animation.</li>
  <li><b>Scripts</b> - you can assign one or more script to a sprite; that way 
  you can programmatically control sprite properties, frames and the animation 
  flow</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another feature of SpriteEdit you may find useful is the ability to set a 
background image for the animation. This is a design-only setting and it can be 
used for example for tweaking an animation to correctly fit a certain game 
background. You can set the background image by opening the &quot;View&quot; menu and then 
selecting the &quot;Background image...&quot; command. A dialog window will appear 
allowing you to specify an image file, an offset of the image (so that you can 
position your sprite within the image) and a transparency for easier designing.</p>
