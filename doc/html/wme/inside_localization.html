<h2>Localization support</h2>
<p>WME supports localization (i.e. translating your game into different 
languages) using two basic principles: the string table and multiple packages.</p>

<h3>String tables</h3>

<p>The <b>string table</b> is a simple text file, which should ideally contain 
all the localizable in-game texts, such as captions, talk subtitle, GUI labels 
and others. The string table contains the dictionary of terms in the following 
format:</p>

<p>Each line of the string table file contains one term, formed by a unique 
identifier, a tab character and the actual text. For example:</p>

<pre><font color="#800000">SYSENG0001	Game settings
SYSENG0002	Display
SYSENG0003	Sound
SYSENG0004	Use hardware acceleration
SYSENG0005	Display device:
SYSENG0006	Colors:
SYSENG0007	Run in window</font>
</pre>
Now, all the texts used throughout the game need to be written down in a special 
format, like this:<blockquote>
  <p> <font face="Courier New" color="#800000">/syseng0001/Game 
settings</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At runtime, the engine extract the identifier and the text 
itself. It then searches the string table for an entry with the same identifier, 
and if it's found, it will be used instead. That way you can have the original 
texts written directly in your scripts (and other game files) and they will only 
be replaced if there is a string table present.</p>
<p>Strings written in this &quot;localizable&quot; format are automatically translated on 
most occasions (for example when calling the
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_actor.html#Talk">Talk()</a> method, you can 
pass the text in this format and the character will automatically say the 
translated line). But sometimes it's necessary to explicitly translate some 
text. For this purpose use the <b>
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_game.html#ExpandString">Game.ExpandString()</a></b> 
method which receives the original text and returns its translated version.</p>
<p>For automatic generation of string tables from your game source files, use 
the <a href="inside_stm.html">String Table Manager utility</a>.</p>
<h4>References from one string table entry to another</h4>
<p>String table entries can recursively reference other entries as well. That's 
useful if you need multiple string table entries to reference the same text. In 
that case, use the following syntax:</p>
<p><pre><font color="#800000">SYSENG0001	Game settings<br>SYSENG0008	/SYSENG0001/</font></pre></p>
<p>Now both SYSENG0001 and SYSENG0008 strings reference the text &quot;Game settings&quot; 
and translators only need to edit the text once.<h4>Automatically locating 
speech files</h4>
<p>String table IDs are also 
used to automatically locate speech sound files corresponding to each line. By 
default, WME looks for speech files in a &quot;speech&quot; directory, but you can set 
other directories using the <b>
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_game.html#AddSpeechDir">Game.AddSpeechDir()</a></b> method.<p>For example, if 
your string table contains line:<p><font color="#800000" face="Courier New">
STR0123</font><font color="#800000">	</font><font color="#800000" face="Courier New">
Hi, I'm Bob. How are you?</font><p>The corresponding speech file should be named 
&quot;str0123.ogg&quot;. If you copy this file to the &quot;speech&quot; directory, WME will play 
the sound automatically when the above line is referenced in any Talk() command.<h3>Unicode support</h3>
<p>The string tables are not limited to standard ASCII texts, they can contain 
Unicode characters, encoded in
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF8">UTF8 format</a>. 
That way you can translate your game to literally any language, including Asian 
and other &quot;double-byted&quot; languages. There are some prerequisites for using UTF8 
string tables, though:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You have to edit the string table in an UTF8-enabled text editor. Windows 
  Notepad in Win 2000/XP is capable of saving text in UTF8 and so is
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ultraedit.com/">Ultraedit</a>.</li>
  <li>You have to use <a href="inside_ui_fonts_ttf.html">TrueType fonts</a> to 
  display in-game texts. <a href="inside_ui_fonts_bitmap.html">Bitmap fonts</a> 
  can only handle up to 256 characters, which makes them unusable for certain 
  languages.</li>
  <li>Use the <b>Game.TextEncoding</b> attribute to switch the game to UTF8 mode 
  (<i>Game.TextEncoding = 1;</i>). The game switches to UTF8 mode automatically 
  if it detects a string table saved in UTF8 format.</li>
  <li>The editor GUI controls currently don't support UTF8 texts, they are only 
  capable of displaying/editing standard ASCII characters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that WME does NOT support Unicode files, only files saved in UTF8 
format.</p>
<h3>Right-to-left reading order support</h3>
<p>To enable support for right-to-left reading order (used by Arabic and Hebrew) 
use the <b>Game.TextRTL</b> attribute. Note that you must use
<a href="inside_ui_fonts_ttf.html">TrueType fonts</a> for this to have any 
effect. Unfortunately you cannot use this attribute to enable right-to-left 
layout for the initial engine settings window, because it's displayed before any 
script is executed. Therefore it's possible to enable right-to-left text 
directly in the string table (similarly to automatic UTF-8 detection in string 
table). To enable right-to-left support, add the following directive to the 
string table:</p>
<p><font color="#800000" face="Courier New">@right-to-left</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Language packages</h3>
<p>But localization isn't limited to texts. Your localized version can have 
different fonts (using a different codepage), some part of the graphics may need 
to be changed, or you can have different sound. For that WME allows you to 
divide your game resources into multiple &quot;packages&quot;. You can then move all the 
localizable resource into a separate package and manipulate is safely 
independently on the rest of the game.&nbsp; See the
<a href="inside_filesystem.html#packages">Packages and file system</a> chapter 
for more details on game packages.</p>
