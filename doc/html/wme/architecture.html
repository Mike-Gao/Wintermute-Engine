<h1>WME architecture</h1>
<p>WME design is strictly object oriented. 
You build your game by creating several types of “objects” and connecting them together 
using the application logic. You manage your game objects using the <i>ProjectMan</i> 
tool. </p>
<p>The most commonly used objects are:</p>
<p><b>Scenes</b> 
– Your game consists of several scenes, these are the “rooms”, the world, or the 
environment where your game takes place. You create the scenes using the <i>SceneEdit</i> 
tool.</p>
<p><b>Actors</b> 
– Actors are the characters appearing in your game. You’ll usually have one main 
actor (the main hero, controlled by the player) and possibly several other actors 
(NPC’s – non-player characters).</p>
<p><b>Entities</b> 
– Entities are generic interactive or non-interactive objects in your game world. 
The scenes are built of entities (you can think of the entities as of the theatre 
properties). You can also use entities to make simple characters, which don’t walk 
(normally you’d use an actor object to create a game character, but as long as the 
character doesn’t walk, it much simpler to use an entity instead). </p>
<p><b>GUI objects</b> 
– WME allows you to create simple graphical user interface elements, such as windows, 
with buttons and fill-in fields. You can use those to design your game’s user interface, 
like save/load windows, game settings, in-game menus etc.</p>
<p><b>Fonts</b> – 
WME uses either graphical (bitmap) fonts or TrueType fonts to display captions, subtitles, GUI elements etc. 
You can create your own fonts matching your game’s graphical style.</p>
<p><b>Sprites</b> 
– A “sprite” is the basic graphical element used in WME. It can be either a static 
image or an animation. The sprites are used to build up the other complex objects 
such as actors and entities. You can create the sprites using the <i>SpriteEdit</i> 
tool.</p>
<p>But your game is really brought to life 
by the <b>scripts</b>. The scripts are simple programs, which provide the actual 
game logic. You can attach the scripts to the objects and those scripts can be than 
executed when a certain event occurs. WME uses its own scripting language, which 
is actually a simplified version of JavaScript. If you are already familiar with 
JavaScript you shouldn’t have problems writing your own WME scripts.</p>
