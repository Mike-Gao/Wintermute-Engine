<h1>Windows Vista support</h1>
<p>Microsoft&#39;s new consumer operating system brought many changes related to 
security and game integration. Both these areas affect game development in WME. 
This chapter will guide you through all the possible problems and new WME&#39;s 
abilities related to Windows Vista.</p>
<h2>Game development</h2>
<p>WME tools and the engine itself work fine in Windows Vista. There&#39;s one 
possible problem you should be aware of, though. In Windows Vista even if the 
user has administrative privileges, under normal circumstances the rights are 
lowered to normal user. This means the user doesn&#39;t have write access to the 
&quot;Program Files&quot; directory. For this reason, do NOT store your WME project folder 
in Program Files.</p>
<p>When creating a new project in ProjectMan, the project is created in the 
&quot;Documents&quot; folder by default, which is fine. Unfortunately older versions of 
WME defaulted to Program Files. Therefore, if your project is in still stored 
Program Files, and you are intending to upgrade to Windows Vista, please move 
the entire project folder elsewhere (preferably to your Documents folder), 
otherwise ProjectMan might fail to compile the game.</p>
<h2>Saved games</h2>
<p>In ProjectMan, in project settings, there is a property called &quot;Personal 
saved games&quot;. It specifies, whether the game will store saved games directly in 
the game directory or if it will use the user&#39;s personal folder. For the reasons 
stated above you should ALWAYS set the &quot;Personal saved games&quot; to &quot;Yes&quot;. 
Otherwise if the user installs your game to Program Files in Windows Vista, the 
game will be unable to save games (actually, WME is smart enough to switch to 
personal saved games folder if the game directory isn&#39;t writeable, but the point 
stands :).</p>
<p>If the &quot;Personal saved games&quot; option is enabled, the saved games are stored:</p>
<ul>
	<li>In Windows XP and earlier: In the user&#39;s &quot;Documents&quot; folder.</li>
	<li>In Windows Vista: In the user&#39;s &quot;Saved games&quot; folder.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Game Explorer integration and rich saved games</h2>
<p>There is a new feature in Windows Vista called &quot;Game Explorer&quot;. It serves as 
a centralized access point for all games installed in Windows. WME provides 
support for integrating your game with Game Explorer, but the process requires 
several steps.</p>
<h3>Game definition file</h3>
<p>To be successfully integrated with Game Explorer, the game must provide so 
called &quot;Game definition file&quot; (GDF). It&#39;s an XML file containing description of 
your game. The complete XML schema for GDF files is available at the
<a target="_blank" href="https://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb173445.aspx">
Microsoft website</a>. However, WME ProjectMan can generate a skeleton GDF file 
for you, based on your game settings. To generate GDF file skeleton, open the 
Tools menu and click &quot;Generate GDF file...&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="../img/vista1.png"></p>
<p>This command will generate an XML file containing some basic information 
about your game. You will probably want to edit the file afterwards to change 
some of the pre-generated values, such as the developer/publisher name, game 
version etc. You shouldn&#39;t change the &quot;gameID&quot; value though, it&#39;s the unique 
identifier of your game.</p>
<p>For advanced editing of the GDF file, such as specifying an ESRB rating, 
you&#39;ll need to install Microsoft&#39;s &quot;Game Definition File Editor&quot; tool, which is 
part of the
<a target="_blank" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/xna/aa937788.aspx">
DirectX Software Development Kit</a>. Also note that for the ESRB rating to be 
displayed in Game Explorer the game executable needs to be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Once you generated the GDF file, you need to tell ProjectMan to insert the 
GDF into the game executable. You do this in the project settings window 
(Project -&gt; Project Settings...) on the &quot;Game Explorer&quot; tab.</p>
<p><img src="../img/vista2.png"></p>
<p>Here you can assign the generated GDF file as well as a thumbnail image. The 
image is used by Game Explorer to display your game. It should be a 256x256 
pixels big PNG file and it can contain transparency. If you don&#39;t specify a 
thumbnail image, WME logo is used by default.</p>
<p>After specifying these options, whenever you compile the game in ProjectMan, 
the GDF file and the thumbnail image are injected into game executable, making 
it ready for Game Explorer integration.</p>
<h3>Rich saved games</h3>
<p>Another step in preparing the game for Game Explorer integration are so 
called &quot;rich saved games&quot;. Windows Vista is capable of displaying saved games 
directly in Windows Explorer, complete with thumbnails and saved game 
description.</p>
<p>To prepare your game for this, two options need to be enabled in project 
settings in ProjectMan. Firstly, you need to set the &quot;Rich saved games&quot; property 
to &quot;Yes&quot;. Secondly, you need to specify a file extension to be used for saved 
games. This extension needs to be unique for your game (i.e. don&#39;t us generic 
extension like &quot;sav&quot;, but rather something like &quot;MyGameSav&quot;). Once the game is 
integrated with Game Explorer, it&#39;s associated with this file extension, so the 
user can double-click the saved game in Windows Explorer, which will run the 
game and load the saved game.</p>
<p><img src="../img/vista3.png"></p>
<h3>Installing and uninstalling the game</h3>
<p>The final step is to actually integrate the game with Game Explorer. This 
action requires administrative privileges and therefore needs to be done at 
install time (the game installer typically has administrative privileges). All 
you need to do is to call the game executable from your installer, specifying 
certain command-line switches, and the engine will integrate the game with Game 
Explorer automatically.</p>
<p>To integrate game with Game Explorer, the installer of your game needs to 
call a command like this:</p>
<p><code>&quot;c:\Program Files\MyGame\Game.exe&quot; -gameexplorer add</code></p>
<p>The above command will install the game with Game Explorer for all users. 
Alternatively you may want to only install the game for current user. The 
command would then look like this:</p>
<p><code>&quot;c:\Program Files\MyGame\Game.exe&quot; -gameexplorer add-current</code></p>
<p>Similarly, when uninstalling the game, you should unregister the game from 
Game Explorer first. To do so, your uninstaller needs to call the following 
command:</p>
<p><code>&quot;c:\Program Files\MyGame\Game.exe&quot; -gameexplorer remove</code></p>
<p>Note: For these commands to work properly the game files need to be 
installed. It means you should call the &quot;add&quot; command as one of the last steps 
of the installation (after the game files have been copied to the user&#39;s 
computer) and the &quot;remove&quot; command needs to be called before the game files are 
removed.</p>
<p>Most installers allow you to call external programs during installation. For 
example when using 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">InnoSetup</a>, your install script would contain something like 
this:</p>
<p><code>[Run]<br>
Filename: &quot;{app}\game.exe&quot;; Parameters: &quot;-gameexplorer add&quot;<br>
<br>
[UninstallRun]<br>
Filename: &quot;{app}\game.exe&quot;; Parameters: &quot;-gameexplorer remove&quot;<br>
</code>
</p><p>Please note that you can safely call these command even when installing 
the game in a different Windows version than Vista. In Windows versions earlier 
than Windows XP the calls are ignored. In Windows XP the engine will write 
special values to Windows Registry and if the user later upgrades to Vista, your 
game will be automatically added to Game Explorer during the upgrade process.<h3>
Game tasks</h3>
<p>Once the game appears in Game Explorer, it provides so called &quot;game tasks&quot;. 
WME installs the following game tasks: Play game, Settings, Website 1, Website 
2. You can control the labels of these actions by modifying the string table of 
your game. If you don&#39;t specify any website, the Website game tasks aren&#39;t 
installed.<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>To conclude, you need to do the following steps to integrate your game with 
Game Explorer in Windows Vista:<ul>
	<li>Enable the &quot;Rich saved games&quot; option in ProjectMan.</li>
	<li>Set a unique saved game file extension in ProjectMan.</li>
	<li>Generate the GDF file in ProjectMan (Tools -&gt; Generate GDF file...).</li>
	<li>Edit the generated GDF file and tweak the game information to your 
	liking.</li>
	<li>Assign the GDF file and a thumbnail image in project settings in 
	ProjectMan.</li>
	<li>Optionally: digitally sign the game executable after compiling the game 
	in ProjectMan (for the ESRB rating to show up).</li>
	<li>Modify your game installer to call the Game Explorer registration when 
	installing the game and the Game Explorer deregistration when uninstalling 
	the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>If all the steps went right, your game should appear in Game Explorer after 
installation:</p>
<p><img src="../img/vista4.png"></p>
<p>And if you select the &quot;Saved Games&quot; command, you should see the saved games 
of your game, complete with thumbnails and descriptions. It you double-click the 
saved game, it should start the game and automatically load the selected saved 
game:</p>
