<h2>WME ProjectMan: the headquarters</h2>
<p>The ProjectMan utility is the place 
where you’ll spend most of the time creating your game. We will now briefly 
describe this program. Run ProjectMan by clicking its icon in the Start menu or 
double click the “WME ProjectMan” icon on your desktop.</p>
<p>The basic interface is similar to most 
of the Windows programs. There is a menu bar, containing all the functions, and 
the toolbar, with icons for the most commonly used tasks.</p>
<p>Select the “File-&gt;Open…” command and 
open the “wme_demo.wpr” file (it’s located in your WME Development Kit folder in 
the “wme_demo” subfolder).</p>
<p>The window is now divided into four 
panes. The left pane contains global properties of your project.</p>
<p>Next there is the project tree pane. It 
shows the layout of your project, all the files and folders. You can browse the 
project tree in a way similar to the Windows Explorer. Most of the functions are 
available via the popup menu (right click the nodes of the project tree to 
display the popup menu).</p>
<p>At the right there is a preview pane. It 
shows a preview of the object currently selected in the project tree pane. It 
helps you to easily navigate through the project.</p>
<p>And the last pane at the bottom-right is 
the help/log pane. It displays either a short description of a selected property 
or a log of certain operations executed by the ProjectMan.</p>

  <td>
    ProjectMan doesn't use any 
    database for storing the objects; everything you see in the project tree pane is 
    actually a view of files and folders on your hard disk.
  </td>
</table>

<p>You can use the ProjectMan for a wide 
variety of tasks but the most important ones are:</p>
<ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
  <li>creating new objects (using the 
  templates)</li>
  <li>invoking editing tools on the 
  existing objects</li>
  <li>running the game</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="creating_objects"></a>Creating new objects</h3>
<p>In the project tree view navigate to a 
folder, in which you want to create a new object. For example, if you want to 
add a new scene, select the “scenes” folder. Right-click the folder and a popup 
menu will show up. Select the “Add” item. Another menu will pop up, which 
contains a list of objects you can add. If you select one, a “Template 
selection” window will appear. Here you can select a template as a starting 
point of your new object. You can fill-in some of its properties and its name. 
After you click the “OK” button a new object is created.</p>
<p>You can also add new files into the 
project by importing existing files or folders. Use the “Import” command in the 
popup menu. The import command is usually used for importing graphics and sound 
files, while the WME’s native objects are created using the templates.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="editing_objects"></a>Editing existing objects</h3>
<p>Editing the existing objects is very 
easy. Just right-click the object in the project tree pane and select an “Edit…” 
command. Alternatively you can simply double-click the objects. ProjectMan will 
then invoke an associated editor on the selected file. It uses the standard 
Windows file associations. It means that you can redefine the tools to suit your 
needs. For example, the scripts (*.script files) are by default opened in the 
Windows Notepad program. If you prefer another text editor, simply change the 
.script file association (using the Windows Explorer). From now on the 
ProjectMan will open the script files in the text editor of your choice.</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111">

  <td>
    <p align="center"><img src="../img/info.png" width="32" height="32"><br><b>Note</b>
  </td>
  <td>
    ProjectMan isn't meant to be a 
    replacement of the Windows Explorer and some file operations are unavailable. 
    That's why it provides an "Explore" command in the popup menu. If you 
    right-click a folder in the project tree pane and select the "Explore" command, 
    ProjectMan will open the folder in the Windows Explorer.
  </td>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="running_game"></a>Running the game</h3>
<p>If you need to test you game while 
developing it, you can run it directly from the ProjectMan. Select the 
“Project-&gt;Run game” command or click the “Run game” toolbar button.</p>
<p>Note that <u>you don’t need to compile 
anything to run the game</u>. The engine will operate directly on the files on 
your hard disk. You only compile the game when you are about to distribute it 
(also it’s useful to compile the game from time to time, because the compilation 
process checks all your scripts for syntactical errors). </p>
