<h3>Step 4: Blocked regions</h3>
<p>We already know that there can be 
multiple regions in the scene and that the regions affect the scene drawing 
order. Those are so called “layout regions”. But there can be also another type 
of regions, the blocked regions. As the name suggests, blocked regions define an 
area within the scene, which the actors cannot enter. In our sample scene, the 
actor can easily walk through the desk. If we want to avoid this, we will define 
a blocked region around the desk.</p>

<p>Let’s do it. Open our “MyScene.scene” 
file in SceneEdit. Make sure you have the “main” layer selected in the layer 
list and then click the “Add region” button. A new region will be inserted into 
the scene (we already did this in <a href="inside_scenes_step3.html">Step 3</a>, remember?).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now look at the properties window. 
Change the name to something more appropriate, like “block_desk” and change the 
radio button from “Layout” to “Blocked”.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../img/tut4-2.png" width="222" height="172"></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK, the region is now blocked; the 
actors will not be able to enter it. All we have to do now it to reshape the 
region to block the table. Change the shape of the region to match the one on 
the picture:</p>


<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../img/tut4-3.png" width="515" height="301"></p>


<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>


<p>And that’s it. You may wonder about the 
scene nodes order. The blocked regions don’t affect the scene drawing and so 
they can be placed anywhere in the nodes list. But it’s a good practice to move 
the blocked regions to the end of the list. It’s not required but it helps one 
to navigate in the scene layout.</p>
<p>Move the “block_desk” region to the end 
of the node list using the “Node down” button.</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../img/tut4-4.png" width="210" height="154"></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Save the scene, quit the SceneEdit and 
run the game. Select the “MyScene” item and test our newly created scene. You 
can see that the actor is no longer able to walk through the desk. But he is not 
able go round the desk neither. That’s what waypoints are for. Proceed to 
<a href="inside_scenes_step5.html">Step 
5: Waypoints</a>.</p>
