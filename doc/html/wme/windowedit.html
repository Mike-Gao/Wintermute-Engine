<h2>WindowEdit tool</h2>
<p>WindowEdit is a tool for creating and editing user-interface elements. The 
game engine provides several control types, which can be used to compose complex 
user interface layer. The supported controls are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Windows</strong> - Window is a container which can contain other 
	controls. Windows can even contain other nested windows.</li>
	<li><strong>Static controls</strong> - Static controls are simple controls, 
	which can either display a static text or a static image (or both). These 
	controls are not interactive and only serve for decoration.</li>
	<li><strong>Buttons</strong> - Buttons provide several states (normal, 
	pressed, disabled, hovered, focused) and they can trigger script code when 
	pressed. Other types of control can be simulated by buttons, such as 
	check-boxes or sliders.</li>
	<li><strong>Editors</strong> - Editors are simple single-line editing fields 
	used for entering text.</li>
	<li><strong>Entity containers</strong> - Entity containers are special 
	controls which allow you to include an entire <a href="inside_entites.html">
	WME entity</a> object within your user interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>Among standard windows, there are also two special kinds of windows serving 
specific purposes:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Inventory boxes</strong> - Inventory boxes are used to display 
	the player's inventory. They consist of a normal window and a rectangular 
	area, which displays the inventory items.</li>
	<li><strong>Response boxes</strong> - Response boxes are used to display the 
	list of responses during dialogues. They consist of a normal window and a 
	rectangular area, which displays the dialogue responses (either textual or 
	iconic ones).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>You can start the WindowEdit tool either by clicking its icon in the Windows 
Start menu, or by double-clicking a .window or a .def file in
<a href="inside_projectman.html">WME ProjectMan</a>. This will either start an 
empty editor or open the appropriate file for editing. The WindowEdit main 
window consists of several areas:</p>
<p><img src="../img/WindowEdit1.png"></p>
<p>The upper-left pane is the <strong>layout pane</strong>. It displays the 
layout of the window. You can quickly find and select any control here. To 
select multiple items, hold down the Control key or the Shift key and click more 
items.</p>
<p>Below the layout pane there's the <strong>property pane</strong>. It allows 
you to view and change the properties of a selected item (or multiple items).</p>
<p>The largest right part of the window is the <strong>editor pane</strong>. It 
contains a live preview of the window you're editing. You can select controls by 
clicking them, you can drag and resize controls using mouse. To select multiple 
controls, hold down the Control key and click more controls. You can also use 
the following keyboard shortcuts in the editor pane:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Arrow keys - Move the currently selected items.</li>
	<li>Shift + arrow keys - Resize the currently selected items.</li>
	<li>Delete - Remove currently selected items.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you hold down the Control key while moving or resizing items by keyboard, 
the movement will use 5 pixels step.</p>
<p>In addition, WindowEdit supports the standard keyboard shortcuts for using 
clipboard and for Undo/Redo. You can also use the toolbar or menu-bar to access 
these functions.</p>
<h3>Adding and reordering controls</h3>
<p>To add a new control, click one of the &quot;Add control&quot; icons on the toolbar or in the 
Control menu. The mouse pointer will change to crosshair. Now either click or 
click and drag anywhere within the editor pane to add a new control of a 
selected type (or right-click to cancel).</p>
<p>If your window contains other nested windows, the new control will be added 
to the window nearest to the point where you clicked.</p>
<p>To change the order of controls (or to assign controls to another parent 
window), simply drag and drop items in the layout pane.</p>
<h3>Changing control properties</h3>
<p>Use the property pane to change properties of selected controls. Some 
properties contain simple textual or numeric value, others allow you to select 
an external file. External files define the used fonts, background images, 
background tiled images (see below) scripts and other. To select an external 
file, select the property you want to change and click the &quot;...&quot; button. This 
will display the file selection window:</p>
<p><img src="../img/WindowEdit2.png"></p>
<p>Here you can either manually enter the path to the file you want to assign or 
browse it on disk using the &quot;...&quot; button. You can remove the currently selected 
file using the &quot;Remove assigned file&quot; (note this doesn't delete the file, just 
removes the assignment). Additionally you can click the &quot;Edit selected file&quot; to 
open the file in an associated external editor.</p>
<p>Once you're happy with your selection, click the OK button to confirm. Please 
note that you cannot assign external files to multiple selected controls at 
once, this is by design.</p>
<p>Scripts are assigned in a similar window, which allows you to attach one or 
more scripts and change their order.</p>
<h3>Tiled images</h3>
<p>You can notice that WindowEdit allows you to attach either an Image or a 
TiledImage. Normal images are either static pictures or
<a href="inside_sprites.html">WME sprites</a> (animations). But what are &quot;tiled 
images&quot;? Sometimes it's useful to specify a special kind of image which can be 
&quot;stretched&quot; when needed. This way you can use the same background for 
windows/controls with variable size. A tiled image looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="../img/tiled_image.png" width="100" height="100"></p>
<p>Basically you divide the image into 9 rectangles (tiles). If you use such 
tiled image as a background image of a control, the inside tiles will get 
repeated to cover the entire width/height of the control.</p>
<p>WindowEdit contains a simple built-in editor for defining tiled images. When 
you use the file selection window to assign a tiled image and you click the 
&quot;Edit selected file&quot; button, the tiled image editor is launched:</p>
<p><img src="../img/WindowEdit3.png" width="383" height="434"></p>
<p>Here you can select the image file and specify the dimensions of tiles. Use 
the toolbar icons to open/save tiled image definition files.</p>
<h3>Inventory and response boxes</h3>
<p>If you edit an inventory box or a response box, an extra item will appear in 
the layout pane, which will allow you to set additional properties of an 
inventory/response box. Also if you select this item in the layout pane, you can 
resize the items/responses area with mouse in the editor pane.</p>
<p>Inventory box automatically displays a preview of the item cells based on the 
inventory box properties.</p>
<p>If the inventory/response window contains buttons named &quot;next&quot; and &quot;prev&quot;, 
these buttons will be automatically used by the engine for scrolling the 
inventory items / dialogue responses. In addition, the inventory window can 
contain a button named &quot;close&quot;, which will be used to dismiss the inventory 
window.</p>
<h3>Options</h3>
<p>You can use the Tools -&gt; Options command to change the default editor values, 
such as the grid size and the colors used.</p>
