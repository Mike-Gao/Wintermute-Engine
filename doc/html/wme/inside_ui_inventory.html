<h3><a name="inventory_box"></a>Inventory box</h3>

<p>The inventory box is the graphical representation of your inventory window. 
It defines the placement of the items, some controls (such as the close and/or 
scrolling buttons) and mainly the design of the background of the inventory.</p>

<p>Inventory box is defined in a simple text file which as a structure similar 
to this:</p>

<pre><font color="#FF00FF">INVENTORY_BOX
{
  ITEM_WIDTH = 65
  ITEM_HEIGHT = 65
  SPACING = 10
  SCROLL_BY = 1
  HIDE_SELECTED = TRUE

  AREA { 30, 12, 770, 77 }
  EXCLUSIVE = FALSE
</font>
<font color="#808080">  WINDOW
  {
    X = 0
    Y = 0
    WIDTH = 800
    HEIGHT = 90
    IMAGE = "interface\inventory.bmp"
  
    BUTTON
    {
      TEMPLATE = "ui_elements\template\but.button"
      NAME = "prev"
      TEXT = "&lt;"
      X = 0
      Y = 0
      WIDTH = 30
      HEIGHT = 90
    }

    BUTTON
    {
      TEMPLATE = "ui_elements\template\but.button"
      NAME = "next"
      TEXT = ">"
      X = 770
      Y = 0
      WIDTH = 30
      HEIGHT = 90
    }
  }
</font><font color="#FF00FF">}</font>
</pre>

&nbsp;<p>As you see, the first part (purple) defines some inventory specific 
attributes, while the second part (gray) defines the design. The second part is 
a casual window, as described in the <a href="inside_ui_windows.html">Windows 
and controls</a> chapter. The inventory window can contain any GUI elements you 
want, please see the mentioned chapter for more details about GUI definitions.</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at the first section. It contains the following 
attributes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ITEM_WIDTH / ITEM_HEIGHT - the dimensions of one cell reserved for each 
  inventory item</li>
  <li>SPACING - the space between two inventory items</li>
  <li>SCROLL_BY - how many items to skip when scrolling the inventory</li>
  <li>HIDE_SELECTED - if player selects an inventory item, it will disappear 
  from the inventory box</li>
  <li>AREA - defines a rectangle within the background window, where the items 
  will be displayed. The four numbers represent the X, Y coordinates of the 
  upper left and bottom right points of the rectangle. Note that the area is 
  defined relative to the inventory window, NOT relative to screen.</li>
  <li>EXCLUSIVE - if the inventory is displayed in exclusive mode, all the other 
  on-screen objects become inactive</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on this setting, WME will automatically populate the defined rectangle 
with items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the second part, i.e. the window definitions, it's a normal window 
definition with a few exceptions. If you name some of the buttons &quot;next&quot;, &quot;prev&quot; 
or &quot;close&quot;, WME will use them automatically for inventory scrolling and/or 
closing.</p>
