<h2>Debugging console</h2>

<p>The debugging console can be used to inspect scripts while running the game. 
The console displays all currently running scripts and the values of all global 
variables and script variables. Additionally it displays WME log.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="../img/console.png"></p>

<p>The developer can set so-called &quot;breakpoints&quot;. Breakpoints are marked script 
lines, which can break game execution and bring the debugging console window 
into foreground. So set a breakpoint, select a script in debugging console. Then 
select the script line and press the &quot;Toggle breakpoint&quot; button (or press F9). A 
red dot will appear beside the line. Now, whenever the engine executes given 
line, it pauses the game and displays the debugging console. To continue script 
execution, switch back to the game window or press the Escape key in debugging 
console.</p>

<p>Similarly you can remove existing breakpoints by selecting an existing 
breakpoint line and pressing the &quot;Toggle breakpoint&quot; button or F9 key.</p>

<p>You can also use the &quot;Step&quot; button (or F10 key) to trace a script line by 
line. Please note that thanks to a multithreaded nature of game programming, 
tracing scripts which rely on other running scripts can slightly change the game 
behavior, because the scripts are executed in different order than without 
tracing.</p>

<p>To stop tracing, press the &quot;Continue&quot; button (or the F5 key).</p>

<p>You can enable or disable the debugging console in project settings in 
ProjectMan. In the &quot;Debug&quot; section there is &quot;Debugging console&quot; item, which can 
be assigned following values:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Never - the console is never executed</li>
  <li>In windowed mode - the console is only displayed when the game runs in 
  windowed mode</li>
  <li>Always - the console is always displayed; only developers with 
  multi-monitor configurations will probably want to enable this option</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these breakpoints, you can explicitly call the <b>
<a href="generated/scripting_ref_functions.html#Debug">Debug()</a></b> function 
from your script, which has the same effect. That way you can script conditional 
breakpoints.</p>

<p>In addition to all global variables and all variables of a selected script, 
you can set your own &quot;watches&quot;, that is only variables that interest you. To add 
a watch, select the &quot;Watch&quot; tab, right-click the tab pane and select &quot;Add 
watch&quot;. Then type the name of the variable you want to watch. To remove a watch, 
right-click the variable name and select &quot;Remove watch&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note that the console is only displayed if the debug mode is enabled.</p>
