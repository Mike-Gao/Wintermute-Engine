<h1>WME features</h1>
<p>The Wintermute Engine (WME) is designed 
to be as flexible as possible yet easy to use. It provides a large set of 
predefined functions plus a scripting layer, which allows you to implement 
advanced custom functionality when needed.</p>
<h3>Some of the notable WME features:</h3>
<ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
  <li>Multiple layered parallax scrolling 
  for scenes (<a href="inside_scenes.html">more</a>)</li>
  <li>3D accelerated rendering subsystem. 
  It allows faster drawing and advanced graphical effects such as transparency, 
  alpha blending and antialiasing. WME also provides non-accelerated renderer 
  for compatibility with older video adapters (with advanced effects disabled)</li>
  <li>Virtually any resolution is 
  supported; user selectable color depth (either 16bit or 32bit, the engine 
  handles the color conversion automatically)</li>
  <li>Actors can move up to 8 directions (<a href="inside_actors.html">more</a>)</li>
  <li>Flexible object-oriented scripting 
  language (<a href="scripting_about.html">more</a>)</li>
  <li>Real-time 3D characters support (<a href="3D_intro.html">more</a>)</li>
  <li>User-interface layer (<a href="inside_ui.html">more</a>)</li>
  <li>Video playback (<a href="inside_theora.html">more</a>)</li>
  <li>GUI tools helping you to create the 
  game content; template-based project manager (<a href="inside_projectman.html">more</a>)</li>
  <li>Scalable game deployment using the 
  package system (<a href="inside_filesystem.html">more</a>)</li>
  <li>Localization support (<a href="inside_localization.html">more</a>)</li>
  <li>Accessibility support (<a href="inside_access.html">more</a>)</li>
  <li>Plugin support (<a href="plugins_about.html">more</a>)</li>
  <li>…and more</li>
</ul>

<h3>In more depth:</h3>
<p><strong><em>Resolution and colors<br>
</em></strong>The engine supports virtually any resolution. Your games may range 
from 320x200 retro-style to high-res 1024x768 modern looking ones.<br>
Both 16bit (hicolor) and 32bit (true color) color depths are supported. The 
player can select a color depth appropriate for his computer and the engine 
handles the color conversion automatically.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Rendering subsystem</em></strong><br>
Since 3D accelerated videocards are a standard today, WME is able to utilize 3D 
acceleration to provide fast 2D graphics in high resolutions, with advanced 
graphical effects such as transparency, alpha blending and antialiasing.<br>
On old computers, WME is able to run in so called &quot;compatibility mode&quot;, which 
doesn't require 3D accelerator, but all the advanced graphics effects are 
disabled.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Development tools<br>
</em></strong>To speed up the development, WME provides a set of GUI tools for 
designing the game scenes, animations and for managing the project contents. The 
tools are powered by the engine itself, therefore they can offer a true WYSIWYG 
:)<br>
Next generation tools are currently under development.</p>
<p><br>
<em><strong>Supported file formats</strong><br>
</em>The engine allows you to use various file formats for storing graphics and 
sounds. It also introduces custom file formats for defining the game objects.<br>
Graphics formats supported: BMP, TGA, PNG and JPG<br>
WME supports PNG and TGA files with an alpha channel.<br>
Sound formats supported: Ogg Vorbis (OGG) and WAV.<br>
Although WME doesn't support the MP3 format due to licensing issues, the Ogg 
Vorbis format is more than a valid replacement.<br>
These sound formats can be used for both music and sound effects. Large sounds 
are streamed from the disk and do not waste the memory.<br>
Furthermore the engine is able to play videos in Ogg Theora and AVI format, including automatic 
subtitles display (SUB format).</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Scripting language</em></strong><br>
WME provides a flexible object-oriented scripting language, which allows you to 
add almost any feature/puzzle you want. All the game objects support a set of 
methods and attributes to allow you an easy access to the internal engine 
workings. You can also create your own custom objects and override and customize 
build-in methods.<br>
The scripting language uses the common C-like syntax, similar to JavaScript, 
C++, C#, Java or PHP. If you know any of these languages, you can immediately 
start to write WME scripts.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Parallax scrolling<br>
</em></strong>Multi-layered parallax scrolling for the scenes is natively 
supported by the engine and the scene designing tool. No additional scripting is 
required to implement it.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Packages</em></strong><br>
Before the game is distributed, it can be compiled into one or more packages. 
The package files contain all the game resources in a compressed form. You can 
choose to split the resources into multiple packages, for example to distribute 
a separate package with sounds/speech, or to release individual game episodes as 
packages.<br>
The packages can have various priorities. It can be used for example to release 
a patch for your game. The patch package will only contain the changed files and 
it will have a higher priority than the original release. The engine will then 
use the new files.<br>
Throughout the development you don't need to compile the game. The engine is 
able to operate directly on the uncompressed files to speed up testing and 
debugging.</p>
<p><strong><em>Support for 3D characters</em></strong><br>
WME includes support for real-time rendered 3D characters. 
This allows WME developers to create state-of-the-art adventure games which 
combine 2D environments with 3D characters (so-called 2.5D games), similar to 
games like Syberia or The Longest Journey. Please see the documentation for more 
details about supported features and requirements. There is a simple
<a href="http://www.dead-code.org/download/wme_demo_3d.zip" target="_blank">demo</a> 
available for download.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>User interface layer<br>
</em></strong>Using several available controls (such as windows, buttons...), 
you can build a complex user interface for your games, such as load/save 
windows, settings window, inventory window etc. All the controls are fully &quot;skinnable&quot;, 
you can change their look to fit your game.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Localization support</em></strong><br>
WME allows you to translate your game into other languages. The localization 
isn't limited to texts, you can create localization packages containing 
localized string table, fonts, graphics or even sounds.</p>
<p><br><i><b>Accessibility support<br>
</b></i>WME provides several options to improve accessibility for 
vision-impaired players. Firstly it's possible to send most of the written text 
to text-to-speech synthesizer, so that the players don't have to read captions, 
which are often too small or disappear too fast to be comfortable to read. 
Secondly it's possible to manually highlight active areas on screen using 
keyboard shortcuts, because normally it can be hard to spot them for people with 
visual disabilities. Thirdly the player can pause the game at any time (using 
the Ctrl+Space keyboard shortcut) to be able to read any text or examine the 
scene without rush.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Community<br>
</em></strong>The friendly people at the WME forum are always willing to give a 
helping hand (and to turn every discussion off topic :)</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Continual development<br>
</em></strong>WME is constantly under development. Updates with new features and 
bugfixes are being released via the WME forum. The Project Manager utility is 
able to check for updates on the internet so that you can download the latest 
version immediately after it's released.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>And a lot of other smaller things</em></strong></p>
<ul>
