<h1>Advanced plugin support in WME</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Note: Plugin development support is only intended for experienced 
programmers who want to expand WME functionality. Others can safely ignore this 
chapter.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although you can call functions from DLL libraries directly from WME scripts, 
as described in <a href="scripting_about_dll.html">this chapter</a>, Wintermute 
Engine is also able to use advanced plugin modules. These plugins are external 
DLL libraries that use a standardized interface to communicate with the engine. 
Advanced plugins can access some of the engine internals, they can receive 
events from the engine and the can serialize/deserialize their state when the 
player saves/restores game. </p>

<p>Plugins can be written using Microsoft Visual C++ .NET or Microsoft Visual 
C++ 6.0. It may be possible to use other compilers/programming languages capable 
of creating native DLL libraries (such as Delphi or Borland C++), but it's 
untested and not officially supported.</p>

<p>If you are releasing a plugin for public use, please consider releasing the 
source codes as well. That way plugins could be recompiled/further developed 
even if the original developer abandons them.</p>
