<h3>Response box</h3>

<p>The response box represents the response selection window for your game. 
It defines the placement of the responses, some controls (such as the  scrolling buttons) and  the design of the background of the 
response selection.</p>

<p>Reponse box is defined in a simple text file which as a structure similar 
to this:</p>

<pre><font color="#FF00FF">RESPONSE_BOX
{
  FONT = "fonts\outline_white.font"
  FONT_HOVER = "fonts\outline_red.font"
  CURSOR = "path\response_cursor.png"
  HORIZONTAL = FALSE
  TEXT_ALIGN = &quot;left&quot;
  VERTICAL_ALIGN = &quot;bottom&quot;
  SPACING = 5

  AREA {40, 0, 800, 170}</font>

<font color="#808080">  WINDOW
  {    
    X = 0
    Y = 420
    WIDTH = 800
    HEIGHT = 180

    BUTTON
    {
      TEMPLATE = "ui_elements\template\but.button"
      IMAGE = "ui_elements\arrow_up.bmp"
      TEXT = ""
      NAME = "prev"

      X = 0
      Y = 0
      WIDTH = 30
      HEIGHT = 30
    }

    BUTTON{
      TEMPLATE = "ui_elements\template\but.button"
      IMAGE = "ui_elements\arrow_down.bmp"
      TEXT = ""
      NAME = "next"

      X = 0
      Y = 150
      WIDTH = 30
      HEIGHT = 30
    }
  }</font>
<font color="#FF00FF">}</font>
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you see, the first part (purple) defines some response-box specific 
attributes, while the second part (gray) defines the design. The second part is 
a casual window, as described in the <a href="inside_ui_windows.html">Windows 
and controls</a> chapter. The response-box window can contain any GUI elements you 
want, please see the mentioned chapter for more details about GUI definitions.</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at the first section. It contains the following 
attributes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>FONT / FONT_HOVER - the fonts setting for the textual responses</li>
  <li>CURSOR - the image to be used as a cursor for iconic responses</li>
  <li>SPACING - the space between two responses</li>
  <li>HORIZONTAL - specifies if the responses are ordered horizontally</li>
  <li>TEXT_ALIGN - specifies the alignment of textual response lines; it can be 
  either &quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot; or &quot;center&quot;; the default value is &quot;left&quot;</li>
  <li>VERTICAL_ALIGN - specifies the vertical alignment of responses within the 
  response area (it has no effect on horizontally ordered items); it can be one 
  of the following values: &quot;top&quot;, &quot;center&quot; or &quot;bottom&quot;; the default value is 
  &quot;bottom&quot;</li>
  <li>AREA - defines a rectangle within the background window, where the 
  responses will be displayed. The four numbers represent the X, Y coordinates 
  of the upper left and bottom right points of the rectangle. Note that the area 
  is defined relative to the responses window, NOT relative to screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on this setting, WME will automatically populate the defined rectangle 
with responses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the second part, i.e. the window definitions, it's a normal window 
definition with a few exceptions. If you name some of the buttons &quot;next&quot; 
or &quot;prev&quot;, WME will use them automatically for the response scrolling.</p>
