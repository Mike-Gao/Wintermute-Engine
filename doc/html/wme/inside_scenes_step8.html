<h3>Step 8: Layers</h3>
<p>The previous step of the tutorial was 
quite difficult. Let’s have some rest in this last step. We will learn how to 
achieve a so called “parallax scrolling”. For this purpose, WME allows you to 
have multiple <b>layers</b> in one scene. If the layer’s dimensions are bigger 
than the game resolution, the layer will automatically scroll. And the bigger 
the layer is, the faster the scrolling will be. If you have, say, three layers, 
each of them having a different width, they will scroll each at a different 
speed. It’s as simple as that. To achieve a realistic perspective effect, the 
largest layers must be closest to the viewer. Another thing you need to know is 
that there is always one “main” layer and the other layers are only a 
decoration. Only the main layer can contain the regions.</p>
<p>Usually, three layers will be enough to 
get good results (background, main layer and foreground), but there is no limit 
on the number of layers in one scene.</p>

<p>We will add a background layer to our 
scene. It will be an image of the sky and it will be visible behind the window.</p>

<p>First of all we need some graphics for 
the layer. Once again the sky image is prepared for you in the “data\tutorial\gfx” 
folder. In ProjectMan, right click the “MyScene” folder and select the 
“Import-&gt;Import file(s)…” command. Browse to the “data\tutorial\gfx” folder, 
select a “sky.bmp” file and click OK. The sky image will be imported into your 
scene’s folder.</p>

<p>Open our “MyScene.scene” file in 
SceneEdit.</p>

<p>You will add a new layer by pressing the 
“Add layer” button above the layer list window. </p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../img/tut8-1.png" width="222" height="129"></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>SceneEdit will open the layer properties 
window. Change the name to “sky” and change the dimensions to 800, 716. That way 
the layer’s horizontal dimension matches the game resolution hence this layer will not 
scroll. Since the main layer WILL scroll, we will get a nice perspective effect. 
The vertical dimension matches the height of the main layer. This way the sky 
image will scroll at the same speed as the background, hence it will be always 
displayed behind the window.</p>


<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../img/tut8-2.png" width="276" height="163"></p>


<p>Click OK to dismiss the layer properties dialog. You have to move the new layer 
to be first in the list (use the up and down buttons).</p>


<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../img/tut8-3.png" width="221" height="148"></p>


<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>


<p>All we have to do now is to add a new 
entity to the newly created layer. We already know the “Add entity” button. 
Press it and select “Add sprite entity”. A new entity will be created. Change 
its name to “sky” and set its sprite to the “sky.bmp” file we’ve imported 
earlier.</p>


<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../img/tut8-4.png" width="215" height="132"></p>


<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>


<p>Now move the entity to properly cover the window.</p>


<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../img/tut8-5.png" width="564" height="325"></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And that’s all. Save your scene and run 
the game. You should see a parallax scrolling in the action.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You have just finished 
your first scene for the Wintermute Engine!!! :-)</p>
