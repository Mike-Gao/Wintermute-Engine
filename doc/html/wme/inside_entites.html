<h2>Entities</h2>
<p>The &quot;entity&quot; is the basic game object used in WME. The scenes are built of 
many entities; for example, the background is an entity, the door is an entity 
etc. The scene entities are created easily using the SceneEdit tool (<a href="inside_scenes.html">learn 
more about SceneEdit</a>).</p>
<p>Other than that, there can be so called standalone entities. Those are used 
for example to create simple characters (usually non-walking characters, 
otherwise the <a href="inside_actors.html">actors</a> are used instead).</p>
<p>There is currently no tool for creating the standalone entities. You must 
create the entity by writing a simple text file, defining the entity's 
properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Animations</h3>
<p>The entity is represented by an animation (<a href="inside_sprites.html">learn 
more about sprites</a>). Since entities can be used to create simple game 
characters, they are allowed to talk. Therefore you can also specify one or more 
talking animations when defining the entity. If you specify more talking 
animations, they are treated as so called &quot;talk stances&quot;. Read more about the 
talk stances in the <a href="inside_actors.html#talking_animations">Actors 
chapter</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="left">Scripts</h3>
<p align="left">The animations described above only define the look of your 
entity, its &quot;body&quot;, so to say. But the actual brain is done by scripting (<a href="scripting_about.html">learn 
more about scripting</a>). As all the other WME objects, the entity can have one 
or more scripts assigned, defining its behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="left">Entity definition file</h3>
<p align="left">OK, we've described what we need to define the entity, now we'll 
assemble those component into one definition file (the entity files use the 
.entity extension).</p>
<p align="left">This is an example of an entity definition file:</p>
<div align="left">
  <pre><font color="#800000">ENTITY
{
  NAME=&quot;MyEntity"
  CAPTION=&quot;My brand new entity"
  X=200
  Y=200
  SCALABLE=TRUE
  INTERACTIVE=TRUE
  COLORABLE=TRUE
  SOUND_PANNING=TRUE
  SPRITE="entities\MyEntity\default.sprite"
  TALK="entities\MyEntity\talk.sprite"
  SCRIPT="entities\MyEntity\MyEntity.script"
  FONT = "fonts\outline_white.font"
}</font>
</pre>
</div>
<p align="left">Description:</p>
<ul>
  <li>NAME - the internal name of the entity</li>
  <li>CAPTION - entity's caption</li>
  <li>X, Y - the initial position</li>
  <li>SCALABLE - whether the entity is affected by the scene scaling</li>
  <li>INTERACTIVE - whether the entity appears to be interactive (it reacts to 
  mouse events)</li>
  <li>COLORABLE - whether the entity is affected by the scene coloring</li>
  <li>SOUND_PANNING - specifies whether all the sounds generated by this entity 
  are automatically panned depending on its position on screen</li>
  <li>SPRITE - specifies the default sprite file to be used to display this 
  entity</li>
  <li>TALK - specifies the sprite to be used as a talking animation for this 
  entity (there can be multiple TALK lines)</li>
  <li>SCRIPT - the script assigned to this entity (there can be multiple SCRIPT 
  lines)</li>
  <li>FONT - the font to be used for entity's speech subtitles</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For an example of a complete entity definition file please see the &quot;WME 
demo&quot; project. There is the &quot;OldGuy&quot; entity prepared in the &quot;entities\OldGuy&quot; folder. 
Also, you don't need to write the definition file from scratch, there is an 
entity template available in ProjectMan (<a href="inside_projectman.html">learn 
more about ProjectMan</a>).</p>
