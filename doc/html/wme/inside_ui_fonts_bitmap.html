<h3>Bitmap fonts</h3>
<p>To display all the game texts (subtitles, captions, GUI texts etc.) WME can 
use so-called &quot;bitmap fonts&quot;. It means the font is formed by an image, which 
contains all the letters. This bitmap font image can look like this:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../img/franklin.png" width="512" height="512"></p>

<p align="left">This image contains exactly 256 characters. As you can see, the 
upper part contains standard alphabet, numbers and punctuation, while the lower 
part can contain special character specific for various national alphabets (such 
as the German umlaut characters, Spanish accents etc.).</p>

<p align="left">Fortunately you don't need to create this image by hand, there 
exist several 3rd party utilities for creating bitmap fonts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<p align="left">
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lmnopc.com/bitmapfontbuilder/">Bitmap Font 
Builder</a> (mailware)</p>

  </li>

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.zen28085.zen.co.uk/playerfactory/fontext/">
FONText</a> (shareware)</p>

  </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">The only think you need to keep in mind while creating the 
bitmap fonts is that the letters need to be <u>left-aligned to the grid</u>. 
What I mean by this? Your letters have some fixed dimensions, for example 32x32 
pixels, in case of the above image. Those dimension actually make an invisible 
grid within your image:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../img/font-2.png" width="409" height="409"></p>

<p align="left">See, the letters are aligned in a 32x32 grid. This is crucial, 
since WME uses this &quot;invisible&quot; grid to recognize where each letter lies within 
the image. Notice that the letters are really left-aligned with the grid:</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../img/font-3.png" width="259" height="280"></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Ok, we have the image itself, but how will WME know where the 
letters lie and how big are they? We will need to create a definition file, 
which describes the font properties. The definition file will look like this:</p>
<pre><font color="#800000">FONT
{
  IMAGE = "fonts\franklin.png"
  TRANSPARENT = 255,0,255
  COLUMNS = 16
  TILE_WIDTH = 32
  TILE_HEIGHT = 32
  AUTO_WIDTH = TRUE
  EXPAND_WIDTH = 1
  SPACE_WIDTH = 4
  PAINT_WHOLE_CELL = FALSE
}
</font></pre>
Description:<ul>
  <li>IMAGE - the image with the letters (such as the one described above)</li>
  <li>TRANSPARENT - specifies which color should be used as transparent; it's 
  the purple color in our case</li>
  <li>COLUMNS - the number of letters columns; as you can see above, we really 
  have 16 columns of letters on our image</li>
  <li>TILE_WIDTH, TILE_HEIGHT - the dimensions of one letter cell</li>
  <li>AUTO_WIDTH - this tells WME to automatically detect the widths of each 
  letter; you could manually specify width of each letter, but it's a tedious 
  work</li>
  <li>EXPAND_WIDTH - you can optionally specify an extra space between letters, 
  in pixels</li>
	<li>SPACE_WIDTH - specifies the width to be used for the space character, in 
	pixels; if you don't specify space width, it will be calculated 
	automatically</li>
	<li>PAINT_WHOLE_CELL - if set to TRUE, the engine will always paint the 
	entire character cell, no matter what the actual character width is; this is 
	useful if you need characters to overlap by specifying a negative number in 
	EXPAND_WIDTH</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that instead of the IMAGE attribute you can also use SPRITE keyword and 
reference a WME sprite instead. This allows you to even create <u>animated fonts</u>.</p>
